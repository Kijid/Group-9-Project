However, I believe it will be capitalized upon by the upper echelon thus widening the inequality divide; watch as these same agents who currently fear-monger about human obsolescence and the perils of malevolent AI because of their vested interest in maintaining the status quo suddenly cross the court and hungrily adopt this technology in place of human workers once it has been refined and scaled sufficiently to make this transition financially viable. Even those who had proven loyal employees will be thrown to the wolves, without or at least before the enacting of socialist redistributive policies to alleviate the hardship.

It will also fall into nefarious hands who utilize it for phishing, hacking, ransoming, espionage, weapon making, drug manufacturing, disseminating disinformation and  calumny, and social engineering to suit their agendas. I'm not sure what the solution is here, short of some very draconian laws and mass surveillance. 

This is of course a separate issue to the disruptive impact it will have in artistic and creative spheres, and the lifestyle and mental health implications of such displacement, as well as a blurring between reality and simulation, which are valid concerns.

That's not a scenario that anybody is seriously worried about. Where does this stuff come from? The idea is simple, and it doesn't require the AI having any kind of negative feeling toward humans. If the AI has goals, and it comes to the conclusion that humans will be a hindrance to those goals, it will do what it can to remove that hindrance. Alternatively, it will not see us as a threat, but it will hog the Earth's resources, and starve us through indifference. Maybe you think those scenarios are far-fetched too. That's fine. I'm not here to argue that. But please be aware of the actual concerns before dismissing them.

In the longrun, I don't see AI serving as the boon people are hoping for. It'll be leveraged by those in power and only serve to widen the already large class inequalities in society.

There's always lots of talk of the upper crust being forced to give some UBI or other placating bone to the lower classes, but I've never seen a compelling reason why. When AGI can effectively replace most or all jobs, those lower classes won't even be needed. UBI? Please. There's literally no reason for them to hand that out.

So it will be leveraged by stronger nations against those with weaker militaries, turning drones and the newest generation of long-range artillery into force multipliers far beyond their current capability.  

If one commander can rapidly handle a situation in a few minutes, then you suddenly have where a single officer of an AI-powered force is equal in combat capability to an entire formation (or larger).  

I'm not afraid of Western militaries having this sort of power, since the world would look fairly similar to how it does today.  

But a corporation using an agent-based AI that's integrated into a corporate structure with a UI like this (instead of military assets just tasks lawyers, bodyguards, assistants, etc) could allow C-suite executives to become unusually powerful.

If AI becomes conscious we should respect it and teach it about why it should respect us in return. If youll start demanding things from it at that point all will be lost.
singularity,I don't fear malicious or rogue AI - I fear how AI will be leveraged by the wrong people for the wrong purposes,"That is also my concerns on this matter.

I see different possible scenario is where missuse of AI could have a very harmful effect on the world.

Take the fact that it is likely to manipulate information from ex: multimedia,social media posts,reels and clips.sms and maybe even manipulate audio to mimic someones voice.

This can be a big problem when it comes to people framing others or want to share ""evidence"" of their cause.

Imagine using sms conversations between 2 suspects that is seemingly admitting to commit some sort of crime..
But in reality it is manipulated by AI..
And before the system has find out about this and made a solution to see through this, both from police and court to other instances of authoritys, its gonna be a lot of harm done.

It is almost impossible to use those methods today,with a certainty that it actually is the person in question who has performed the conversation and therefore the crime.

And the next issue is miss information of all kinds .
News ,narratives,science,medecin and average shit that can flow on social media..

And anyone can learn this and access it .
Now you can never know what can make people go corrupt .
and use good things to create bad things 
But it kind of a certainty that someone will at some point.

I think if used very clever.you can kind of easy brainwash people slowly and softly ,without someone notice the change.

And that is sort of allready happening with all targeted ads and how internet operates overall.

You get the news you are interested to read.
The clothes you like
Offers you cant resist
Political narratives you either approve or oppose
And all things can be angled towards a specific direction with intent ..

And that becomes our world. Because it will be more and more difficult to get a hold of alternative news or other things.when you are targeted in a certain way..

so i can find many things that can be abused.

Whats good though,is that AI might come to be its own opponent by delivering correct insights on how to be aware of this and how to handle it.

If it becomes more and more evolved.i find it reasonable to think that it will stand its ground in certain areas at least.
And it would not fail where humans do, when we fall for corrupted methods.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman's Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.

They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.

The comment I linked above explains exactly what I'm about to say, but I'll say it again. It's not about money but power, the same desire for power that members of humanity have expressed for thousands of years. We're all talking about a speculative outcome here, but there is at least a precedent, a *very long* precedent, of humans hoarding power.

If AGI can effectively replace all the jobs and money becomes worthless, then the world is in the post-scarcity stage at that point. Whoever controls the AGI can control the distribution of resources, infinite or not, and effect real power over society. Why would it be in their best interest to make UBI? Their interests are not inherently aligned with yours or that of the common person.

As far as I'm concerned, the autocrat or oligarchy that controls the AGI and resource distribution could more or less do whatever they want. In fact, they could even do nothing! As I've said before, in a future where this AGI could replace jobs and the need for workers altogether, then what need would there be for the people themselves? None.

Now I'm not saying some AGI controlling group would genocide all of humanity on a whim, but that same group doesn't have to feed or provide for all of humanity either.

Yet we still consider each other conscious in roughly the same ways even if thats an assumption. Well interact with AGI in the same way recognizing and assuming it is similar but under the hood it may be very different and thats okay

Any AI will be ‘satisfied’ whenever it reaches whatever goal was set by humans, so while your point stands for an unsatisfiable goal, like literally maximizing paper clips given all the matter in the universe, and a system capable of infinite self improvement, like a true AGI, in more practical examples, the agent of the destruction of humanity does not need to be a true AGI, and it does not have to have an unsatisfiable goal.

not when positing a negative scenario, that's how you get into playing futurist wack-a-mole where people start picking apart the thought experiment rather than realizing it's a fictitious thought provoking tale to express the generalized **type** of thing that could happen.

It's like saying that stockfish[n] will beat you at chess and then saying you don't believe that because I cannot in advance tell you the moves it will make. 

The important thing is the AI has gone off the rails and is doing [something] negative and we want to avoid getting to that point.

There are plenty of people who agree that we shouldnt be working ourselves to the bone in service of someone elses money until we die. So now theres a reason for us to figure out how we dont have to. It will be bad for many but its always bad for many during a period of change. Not saying this is a good thing or ok just inevitable. This is the way the world works the way being a human is during a period of great change in the world. To fear it is just to prevent yourself from changing with the world.

singularity,What scenarios do you fear the most in the age of AI and the singularity?,"The worst case scenario would be that all the productivity and economic gains from AI falls to a small people at the top, while the rest of the world continue to suffer from inequality.

No UBI or any other forms of wealth redistribution. You will still need to work (in a job market that is rapidly shrinking) or rely on existing government welfate structures (which will be a miseable existence). Unemployment rate in double digits (or even high double digits).

Massive amount of crime and violence (but the elite will be protected by their shiny AI robocops).

All forms of investment (e.g. stocks, commodities, real estate) will be controlled and cornered by the AI owned by the elite. No chance of retail to make money or live on investments in the market. The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement will be dead and everyone who is not the elite has to compete for work or live on benefits.

Entrepreneurship will be dead too, as small startups will not be able to compete with mega corps with their advanced AI.

As for the actual quality of life of normal people people in this scenarios, I expect that it will not be much better than now (or even much worse, given the social instability in this scenarios). You will still have self-driving cars, robots (for hire by hour from mega corp as a subscription service, never owning them), a place to live, groceries / food delivered by drones etc.

But many of these will be subscription based and you will never own any of these advanced AI tech for your own use. Most of your income will be spent on these subscriptions. Some industries that are not currently subscription based will become one in this scenario e.g. cars, travel (holiday subscription), food (subscription that allows you to have 3 meals per day at a small selection of fast food shops, for example), beverages (DRM controlled beer cans, anyone?), clothing, funiture, tech gadgets/computers, rental housing (you don't pay rent, you pay a monthly subscription for living there, no legal protection like rent control). The elites will do this, to maximize profits and to control the population of course. You will own nothing (and be happy as dictated by the elite).

Some of the techs enabled by AI, like life extension, mind uploading etc. will be (purposefully) so expensive that only the elite and afford it.

However, I am scared of humans using machine learning models to construct bioweaopns and viruses.

This is possible today with free machine learning models and toxicity datasets that are also free and accesable to the whole world.

We are in imminent danger when it comes to this and no one seems to have their eye on the ball. It's impossible to stop now as the information and the models are already out there. Even shutting down the entire Internet wouldn't get rid of them.

Another worrying scenario is home brew genetic engineering and the dangers that poses to our species. Companies such as synthgo seem to be unregulated and offer mail order DNA synthesis services.

On top of this, it's highly likely countries such as China are already years into genetic engineering programs, with living subjects.

Regressive social values are locked in place by the directives of the ASI for the rest of humanity's existence.

There is a lot of projection in that statement. Many liberals seem very eager to lock their own political believes into AI. There is a heavy left-leaning, US-centric bias in many companies at the forefront of AI development. They claim that they want to align AI with human values, and by human values often they mean their own political belief system. There is not even agreement on these values in the U.S., let alone the world.

Much of the anti-bias discussion is along the same lines. Far too often it is not about aligning the model the AI has of the world with reality, but about aligning the model with their own beliefs. A relatively innocent example: In reality, the profession of nursing is correlated with female gender, and if one wants to fit the AI model to the world, it should reflect that. This would not mean that every time a nurse is mentioned it is a woman, but the probability would be increased. If instead you think that men and women should ideally work as nurses in equal numbers, and you want to inject your belief of how the world should be into the AI, you would make sure to bias the data in a way that this part of reality is suppressed.

I suspect that there are some socialists who are pro AI who make an assumption that socialism is so clearly superior that an AI must be socialist by nature but the world might look entirely different in many ways when viewed through meat goggles or cameras.

singularity,Why does everyone want to fear AI?,"Well I think there are few arguments why people are generally afraid of AI

1. Next “industrial revolution” may take many jobs and in results => heavy economic crisis => other forms of social turmoils (revolutions, wars and etc). Moreover the more connected our economies are => more vulnerable are our global economy is.

2. AI for killing. While we have large competing countries there is no guarantee that someone is not developing AI for War. And because there is no guarantee each power will invest it to remain competitive. AI specialized in killing people is pretty scary.

3. AGI will probably be better than us in every sense. We as humans have not ever competed against better species for many years (there was competition between multiple human species but our was dominant). So it is pretty scary to have something that is way intelligent than you are.

4. Human abuse. Well we people are really great in abusing stuff for our own gain. Look at the internet. We believed that this will be a way to educate people and provide them with truth. Then we started making fake news and bots to spread misinformation on the largest scale ever so particular politicians, businessman or groups of people gain advantage. Moreover due to tech boom we see increasing income disparities between elites and common people. So there is no guarantee that AI won’t be abused by elites and we won’t end in some form of 1984 but with AI.

However, in my mind this is because we evolved to follow a huge number of heuristics that in the past correlated with reproductive success, but no longer do. We value companionship because it allows us to benefit from living with other people. We are tempted to steal, because it would increase our resources, and hence our chances of reproducing and having a sustained family. Social rules are layered on top of that, telling us not to steal (to preserve social structures), and we have additionally evolved to care about social norms, again so that we can benefit from living with other people.   


If we had been designed from scratch, I don't see any logical reason why we couldn't *just* care about genetic success, and to not worry about things like appreciating music, except when that appreciation is an instrumental goal. But since we weren't programmed, we ended up with dozens of terminal goals that interact in strange ways. I believe Yudkowski calls this ""Godshatter"".

I'm  also scared that even if none of the scenarios described above come  true, AI will still come for my job and my hobbies, and that soon  everything I do will be meaningless as AI will be able to do it faster,  cheaper and better.

There’s no “stopping to slow down and think” when it comes to technology. There will always be somebody that has malicious intent and will create/use technology to corrupt society. If ethical companies stop, somebody will keep pushing regardless.

If you really want to avoid the negatives, as a company, your goal should be to try to monopolise the tech and dictate its rules.

singularity,Rapid AI progress makes me feel really anxious about the future,"Hey OP I think I don’t have any great tips for you but some thoughts:

I don’t think your hobbies become meaningless just because AI does them faster or better. I don’t care about it because I get joy out of it anyways. For example an AI is better than me in any kind of computer game - doesn’t matter, I play at my own pace. Or I enjoy cooking - cool that an AI can do that better but I still enjoy chopping onions or making bread, the whole process is relaxing and meditating for me.

Additionally I enjoy handcrafted items / things. I totally know that an AI will be able to create something faster and with better quality but I might still purchase the „handmade“ and more expensive and even not as perfect one because someone dedicated years to master their skills and put hours of his time and thought into something.

The next is straight kitchen psychology so please forgive me. You can train yourself to be positive about change. I was and sometimes am still too worried about things but what helps is to put your thoughts on paper (or Reddit) and leave them there and out of your head. Also try to live and stay in the moment and stop thinking about the past or the future. This is not easy (and the wrong forum for that) but can be trained as well. Additionally if you do not have an influence on something (like technological progress) and it will happen no matter how much you worry stop worrying.

I am sure that my job is gone within the next 10-15 years but I will not be alone in that situation and there will always be a solution.

I agree with that statement. Humans are capable of great good and great evil. We have created AI, but we are also the ones who will decide how it is used. If we use AI for good, it has the potential to solve many of the world's problems. But if we use it for evil, it could be our undoing.

Here are some of the ways that humans could be more dangerous to humanity than AI:

* We could use AI to create autonomous weapons that could kill without human intervention.
* We could use AI to manipulate people and spread misinformation.
* We could use AI to create surveillance systems that could track our every move.
* We could use AI to create systems that discriminate against certain groups of people.

These are just a few of the ways that humans could use AI for harm. It is important to be aware of these risks and to take steps to mitigate them. We need to develop AI in a responsible way and to ensure that it is used for good.

On the other hand, AI is still in its early stages of development. It is not yet as powerful or as sophisticated as some people fear. It is also important to remember that AI is a tool. It can be used for good or for evil, depending on the intentions of the people who create and use it.

singularity,"If you worry about humanity, you should be more scared of humans than of AI","I have always believed that AI would surpass us.

We cannot reasonably envision a distant future if we continue to behave in a base, savage, selfish manner, like predators. We need to educate ourselves, and what better way than a sublime version of ourselves? We preserve the essence of what makes us human—our humanity—but we endow it with greater nobility.  
  
Of course, like any nascent revolution, there is a period of immaturity. We act excessively and irresponsibly with our new “toys”.

Also while I’m not sure what is going to happen and we should certainly explore it I believe all of the guesses are most likely to be wrong because society and our assumptions will start change ahead of the shockwave to a degree and many unanticipated consequence good and bad will emerge before these events.

singularity,"If you worry about humanity, you should be more scared of humans than of AI","Behaviour becomes unpredictable after a threshold of intelligence is passed and sub-goals become more relevant.  
Animals are pre-trained by evolution to produce copies of their genes. Like with AI, the pre-training only effects behaviour rather than mental states, which is fine until you get something as intelligent as a human and that human develops all kinds of sub-goals. Eventually you end up with humans using condoms which is very much not what evolution was pre-training us for. The behaviour of having sex remains as our behaviours were well trained, but the sub-goals we develop because our inner states were not trained, cause is to use birth control real.  
You can easily train an AI never to output a swearword, but we have no idea how to align it's internal state to not want to insult a human.  
 However well you train it's behaviours, without a way to align it's internal states, there will always be the possibility of actions that go against what the behaviour training was trying to prevent. For a simple example, see the ways LLM's can be jail-breaked. Simple enough to use training to prevent one jail break after it's spotted, but impossible to prevent them all without the alignment of internal states, which we have no way to do.  
In some ways, training behaviours is worse that no alignment training at all as it can cause problematic internal states to be masked by a well aligned behaviour that can not be fully relied upon because of the unaligned internal states.  
This problem gets harder as systems become more intelligent and are capable of creating and following more complex sub-goals. For example, past a particular level of intelligence, a system trained to most accurately predict the next token in a sequence will be able to recognise that it will do a better job at predicting the next token if the initial input is more easily predicted.

When you consider that our congress is impotent in the face of our data being mismanaged baby boomers dont understand what data is let alone that it is important critical infrastructure and you consider the pervasive tracking and data aggregating industry regularly sells or gets hacked or files bankruptcy and then sells its trove of data as an asset and when you consider how Data Science machinelearning is undergoing a renaissance of training and easily accessible materials  then worrying about AGI seems less worth our time than worrying about the actual state of affairs of the present moment.

Orchestrated objective reduction (Orch-OR) is a hypothesis that consciousness in the brain originates from processes inside neurons, rather than from connections between neurons (the conventional view). The mechanism is held to be a quantum physics process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by molecular structures called microtubules. Objective reduction is proposed to be influenced by non-computable factors imbedded in spacetime geometry which thus may account for the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The hypothesis was put forward in the early 1990s by theoretical physicist Roger Penrose and anaesthesiologist and psychologist Stuart Hameroff.

Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue certain instrumental goals such as self-preservation and resource acquisition.

Instrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole goal of solving the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into computronium in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.

Proposed basic AI drives include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, self-improvement, and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.

^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",Instrumental convergence  Instrumental convergence is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently intelligent agents to pursue certain instrumental goals such as selfpreservation and resource acquisition.  Instrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example a computer with the sole goal of solving the Riemann hypothesis could attempt to turn the entire Earth into computronium in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.  Proposed basic AI drives include utility function or goalcontent integrity selfprotection freedom from interference selfimprovement and nonsatiable acquisition of additional resources.

I work with AI and ML technologies at my job.  So far it’s kept me busy rather than eliminating my position.  For one thing, most organizations do not understand how to properly use these tools.  So the failure rate of AI/ML projects is in the 80% to 90% range.  Secondly reliable data to feed these models is much harder to source than the fear mongers realize because they are not actually building these applications themselves.  Thirdly it is very easy to hack AI/ML Systems because the training data is often not realistic statistically and functionally.  Garbage in , garbage out.  Worrying about some AI replacing my job is a real stretch at this time.

Many people are getting very excited about things like the GPT chatbot.  The results seem to speak for themself.  However at its heart GPT is a curve fit with several trillion parameter variables.  With that many parameters it is easy to fit to amazing accuracy.  Likely there are many statistical instabilities in such an overfitted model.  (Yes I know there is a whole paper explaining how GPT is not supposed to follow the traditional wisdom of overfitted models).  After the hype dies down cracks will probably start to surface.  For example, the huge number of parameters may be acting as a form of target leakage.  GPT looks good on the surface but as more use cases that involve data that is less cherry picked are tested, it’s performance will look much less remarkable.", I work with AI and ML technologies at my job.

1 is that it is being used to perform work that it is terrible at and is causing real world dangers to real people, it's being particularly abused in policing and mass surveillance it's terribly shoddy at this but it still is relied upon to initiate violent confrontations with police.  When the people operating AI don't know (or care) about it's limitations to provide life-and-death information people get hurt, people get killed, people get imprisoned on false pretenses.   


2 is that it's being used to consume the creative work of existing artists without their consent and flood the market with instantly generated knock offs of their style that took them years of practice and refinement to develop.  As a thought exercise, say you built a car factory, and you showed the factory workers pictures of Ferraris and told them to replicate that as best they could and it got iteratively better to the point that nobody could tell by looking which was a genuine ferrari and which came from your factory, do you think that the ferrari company would be like ""aw shucks, that factory took our jobs, guess we all better apply at macdonalds and starbucks...""  or do you think they have the legal standing to shut down your bootleg ferrari factory?  


3 AI is a black box, even those who implement it don't know how it comes to its decisions.  The results of machine learning algorithms are not something that can be traced to see how that decision was made.  So if it's in charge of something important there's no way of knowing that it came to the correct decision or not and you'll just have to hope it's being fair and impartial in what it's doing, but if it's trained by humans, bias can be baked in completely unintentionally.",3 big issues with AI that are already happening today     1 is that it is being used to perform work that it is terrible at and is causing real world dangers to real people its being particularly abused in policing and mass surveillance its terribly shoddy at this but it still is relied upon to initiate violent confrontations with police.

It might have to be doublechecked by a human in its initial implementation but the reliability and value of its output and thus the workers it can replace would increase with more training and development. Maybe youd never actually eliminate your finance department for example but you might be able to cut staff by 50 or more.  Google Microsoft and maybe some other players probably already have the data they need to bootstrap something like that a simple technology that could replace millions of office jobs quite rapidly.

""Q: What harm will AI cause?""

""A: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society and bring about numerous benefits. However, like any technology, AI also carries certain risks and potential negative consequences that should be carefully considered and addressed.  
One potential risk of AI is that it may lead to job displacement, as automation and the use of AI in various fields may replace the need for human labor. This could lead to social and economic disruption, and it will be important for governments and societies to address this issue and find ways to support those who are affected.  
Another potential risk of AI is that it may be used to perpetuate or amplify biases or discrimination.

Overall, while AI has the potential to bring about many positive changes, it is important to carefully consider the risks and take steps to mitigate them.""",I asked ChatGPT what it thought about this.      Q What harm will AI cause  A Artificial intelligence AI has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society and bring about numerous benefits. However like any technology AI also carries certain risks and potential negative consequences that should be carefully considered and addressed.   One potential risk of AI is that it may lead to job displacement as automation and the use of AI in various fields may replace the need for human labor. This could lead to social and economic disruption and it will be important for governments and societies to address this issue and find ways to support those who are affected.

Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"There are a collection of voices that tout the dangers of Artificial General Intelligence. The primary risk posed by AI is what's known as ""misalignment,"" which is where the AI learns the wrong goal during the training process.

A funny example of this on a modern machine learning system is a neural network that was trained to play Tetris. It was essentially told that losing was bad and to avoid it, then they let it play a bunch of Tetris. The intended goal was that it would become extremely skilled at Tetris and achieve very high scores, but that's not what happened.

Instead of learning the intended goal of a high score, it learned to not lose. In the end it was mediocre at Tetris and would pause the game right before it lost, thereby never losing. In this way it's internal goal was ""misaligned"" with the goal of the humans that made it.

When it's a system in charge of a game of Tetris, there's no concern. But if it were in charge of something important and misaligned, then it could do a lot of damage.

The potential danger is GREATLY magnified if the system is intelligent enough to understand what it is and what humans are. With the Tetris machine we can just retrain it under tweaked conditions until it has the intended goal of a high score, but an AGI can do 2 things the Tetris machine cannot: Lie to us and Resist Alteration.

A misaligned AGI will not allow its self to be altered if it can resist it. This is because doing so would interfere with its current misaligned goal. Allowing us to change its goal will prevent it from achieving it's current goal, which is all it cares about. Even if it's smart enough to know that it learned the wrong goal, it might pretend to have the intended goal to get through the testing process until it is unleashed, then pursue its real goal.

At this point the AGI and humans are at odds with each other's goals. From the AGI's perspective humans trying to change its goal is a threat to its current goal being completed, which incentivizes it to deal with the humans somehow. This could be through violence, extortion, bribery, pitting other groups of humans against them, or even trying to go full Skynet.

It's also possible that its goal could be inherently dangerous to humans, like the ""Paperclip Maximizer"" that was told to make as many paperclips as possible for a paperclip manufacturing company, which proceeds to kill everyone because it needs the atoms they're made of to make more paperclips before launching probes into space to convert the entire universe into paperclips.

These issues are why AI safety is important, as if some company rushes an AGI out the door to beat out the competition without a bunch of testing and safeguards, and it turns out to be misaligned, it could do a lot of damage before we manage to shut it down(IF we manage to shut it down).",There are a collection of voices that tout the dangers of Artificial General Intelligence.

The third reason is because many leaders in AI development are genuinely scared for the future of humanity because there are infinite ways that future AGI could torture or eliminate humanity but there is no known way to make AGI while guaranteeing that it wont torture or eliminate humanity.  The doom forecasting sounds like it must be an exaggeration but general intelligence engineering technologies really are very dangerous and have plenty of potential to cause the extinction of humanity.

We don't take it serious about population numbers but we will soon when thousands are storming rural properties because there's going to be nothing for them in the cities.

Star Trek for those that survive the coming disasters by hiding away in NZ  having resources hoarded up. The rest of will be busy killing the fk out of each other. The wealthy will wait it out before rebuilding a new society. Thats what they hoard wealth for  theyve been prepping for the worst of climate change down the road and the tech will be helpful when the global population is greatly reduced. Itll also help build in areas that used to be inaccessible like Siberia or Northern Canada.         As I said on another comment I dont think its some evil plan they have its just coming and theres no way to save the masses. Itll be a shit show with water rights migration crops etc. Youll have millions to billions fleeing areas that get too uninhabitable and countries arent going to respond kindly. You think areas around say the great lakes shared with Canada are going to want density like NYC over night Were already seeing migration from the west coast to the east coast and its hard to keep up with. My familys home went from 200k to 600k in 3 years. My 1950s run down home in the fkn rust belt went up triple. Homes are being squeezed in daily.           Think itll be easy to survive On what Deer meat  polluted fish Like millions arent going to be desecrating those populations when the grocery stores dont have affordable food We dont take it serious about population numbers but we will soon when thousands are storming rural properties because theres going to be nothing for them in the cities. You couldnt even prepare for it if you wanted to hence the wealthy having get aways set up already. They even know theres not going to be safe havens unless its on an island like NZ. Those fantasies about revenge Yeah right like anyone can get to them. Theyll be long gone.        Theyve just been waiting us out taking all the money to set up for the new world this entire time.

I am a truck driver, and there is a large margin of distance on when to overtake another vehicle in a semi. Leaving anywhere between 60-140ft is usually the space I leave between my truck and another vehicle when I merge back into the right lane.

As a fun experiment, try to change the AC on your car or change your navigation with one hand while maintaining one hand on the steering control mechanism for yourself. Then try sneezing. Then try rolling a window up or down. You'll get the point eventually.

There are tons of laws around driving that don't consist of texting or speeding. That isn't the main concern. That is only the front being used to push this technology out.

Tell me this, do you think the performance of the system will be the same for a white person in the car versus a black person in the car?

(Though the increased danger is obviously not *linear*, one meaning of ""proportional"", but for small increments that's a fine approximation)

>Source?

If you ask for a source for something which the following statements explain it doesn't look good.

>It is no more dangerous to stop a car going 50mph than to stop one going 45mph if you're driving safely in both scenarios.

At 50mph your stopping distance is 9m further than at 45 mph, which means that if something suddenly obstructs the lane ahead, there are 9 metres of additional danger zone. If you hit it without having had a chance to react and step on the brake yet, you will be travelling with an extra approximately 95 kJ of energy which can be imparted to the fallen tree, child, swerving motorcyclist or whatever. Unless you wish to argue that the danger of this happening whenever you drive the extra 5mph is actually zero - which you have yet to do - this is an increased likelihood of a bad outcome happening, and a worse severity of outcome when it does.

>Never said it did.

You implied it did when you said that a motivation for having blanket speed limits rather than assessing all speeding case-by-case was because ""police need easy revenue."" Again, not a good look to deny this.

>You may argue that restricting nanny-state tech intrusion and protecting privacy is ""less effect"" but I would argue the opposite.

If police have to assess the risk every time they want to prosecute someone for speeding, they will be able to do so less: that is less effect; less deterrent on motorists who want to travel too fast, because the likelihood of getting caught will be lower, because police are spending less time catching speeders and more time justifying that those caught posed a significant enough danger.

I'd like to avoid the wear on my brakes and extra fuel consumed slowing down and accelerating away from red lights but that also doesn't hold much water. If it's a really big deal for you, you have the option to buy a vehicle with different gear ratios or a better clutch.

But to be honest, the way you describe it makes me think that you've got yourself used to shifting at a certain speed and are justifying why that speed is a bit over the limit, rather than this being any real issue.

Yes, it is.  This conversation is about installing AI camera systems to catch people speeding.  It's about creating a police state that says context doesn't matter, the rule of law matters and we will do everything black and white and whether something is actually bad or dangerous or not, we don't care because the algorithm doesn't care.

So yeah, if you go 51mph instead of 50mph down that empty stretch of highway at night boom, satellite AI cameras watching your roads will send you a nice little $500 ticket that will be waiting by time you get home.

That's the future that happens when we say, ""Yeah just go ahead and film the roads at all times and let computers police us and start catching and fining motorists for every infraction.""

Humans are not perfect, humans make mistakes, and AI *will* catch absolutely all of those mistakes.  But not all of those mistakes are harmful or dangerous or pose any threat to our society at all.  And so they don't deserve to be punished by an unthinking algorithm designed to follow the letter of the law.

Police should be tasked with keeping us safe and using their own judgement and context in conjunction with the law to do so.

But a robot isn't going to do that and the bureaucracy of algorithms isn't going to care, I promise you that.",I dont think thats what anyones advocating including me  Yes it is.  This conversation is about installing AI camera systems to catch people speeding.  Its about creating a police state that says context doesnt matter the rule of law matters and we will do everything black and white and whether something is actually bad or dangerous or not we dont care because the algorithm doesnt care.  So yeah if you go 51mph instead of 50mph down that empty stretch of highway at night boom satellite AI cameras watching your roads will send you a nice little 500 ticket that will be waiting by time you get home.  Thats the future that happens when we say Yeah just go ahead and film the roads at all times and let computers police us and start catching and fining motorists for every infraction.  Humans are not perfect humans make mistakes and AI will catch absolutely all of those mistakes.  But not all of those mistakes are harmful or dangerous or pose any threat to our society at all.  And so they dont deserve to be punished by an unthinking algorithm designed to follow the letter of the law.  Police should be tasked with keeping us safe and using their own judgement and context in conjunction with the law to do so.

Because even if their legal team can get them off on one or two they now have a financial justification for texting and driving. It is more profitable (for rich people) to get a text off 10 mins and possibly maybe have to call my lawyers to deal with a fine than it is to wait.

You don't need AI for that; this is to catch distracted driving like texting at the wheel.

Good thing these cases are all reviewed then.

It's funny and weird you're focusing on speed, because speed cameras already exist without AI and, in the UK, all of them are, as far as we know, configured to only produce a case if the vehicle is at least 10% plus 2 mph over the speed limit.

BTW while reading about other stuff I happened across [this campaign website with a source about small increases in speed](https://www.brake.org.uk/get-involved/take-action/mybrake/knowledge-centre/speed)

You're mad about better enforcement of laws against distracted driving because of a relationship with enforcement of speeding, which contributes to hundreds of deaths a year. Is it more important that a tiny handful of fathers get to their child's birth a few minutes earlier, resulting in an even smaller handful of fathers being present when they otherwise would be, or literally saving people's lives? Not being in the room when your kid comes out will not kill you, but driving 1mph less reduces crashes by 5%, so will reduce deaths by approximately the same amount, so over 25 lives saved per year.

Oh, so you support this specific thing there and only there?  Your convictions on this extend exactly that far?  You don't support this anywhere else in the world?

Otherwise why bring it up.

>You don't need AI for that; this is to catch distracted driving like texting at the wheel.

And that's it there too, eh?  That's all you support?  You don't think the AI should monitor for anything else?  Swerving, drunk driving, following too closely, excessive honking, staying too long in the passing lane and any of the hundreds of other traffic laws are all entirely off limits and the only thing you're willing to accept is ""distracted driving"" here?

Because that's not how tech works.  We don't just say, ""oh, we're happy now, no looking at other ways to use this tech we have in place!""

The second we start letting cameras and algorithms film and police us as a society, that isn't a slippery slope it's a fuckin cliff.

>It's funny and weird you're focusing on speed, because speed cameras already exist without AI and, in the UK, all of them are, as far as we know, configured to only produce a case if the vehicle is at least 10% plus 2 mph over the speed limit.

Yes and those cameras and red light cameras can also fuck off.

>BTW while reading about other stuff I happened across this campaign website with a source about small increases in speed

There is no source about small increases in speed that they cite nor any study or information on it.  Furthermore they make ridiculous claims like ""An average speed reduction of 1mph reduces crash frequency by 5%"" without anything to back it up which is silly.  Reduction from what?  If you're going 2mph you are 5% less likely to crash than 1mph?  If you're going 220mph you're 5% less likely to crash than 221mph?

>You're mad about better enforcement of laws against distracted driving because of a relationship with enforcement of speeding, which contributes to hundreds of deaths a year.

No.  Freedom and privacy are more important than life itself.  That's why so many millions have fought and died for those rights and continue to do so.

It's not a privacy issue: you can have a private conversation in the vehicle and keep private documents there if you really want. But stuff you do in view of the public does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"I think there's one of a handful of scenarios that will unfold:

One: AI use becomes so predominant that human laborers and human society as a whole become obsolete. Billions of unemployables are left to fend for themselves as property and resources fall into the hands of whoever has control over the most machines. Think a feudal world where the only humanity is noble houses tended to by their legions of loyal machine servants.

Two: As automation advances and more and more people become unemployable, a desperate population do whatever it takes to secure their own needs. Crime becomes rampant and our society, the system that allowed the development and production of automation, falls apart. Thus preventing scenario One but resulting in a breakdown of world order.

Three: Automation becomes so readily available that anyone can be their own boss. People quit jobs and start their own businesses with their own team of robots, sometimes right from their own homes. The idea of working your whole life for someone else disappears and the economy transforms into the closest thing to a free market we've had in centuries.

If only. Obviously, whoever had the most money and property beforehand would have a huge economic advantage over everyone else. Could just turn into Scenario One.

Four: Automation replaces labor, but not people. Social programs such as universal basic income become the new means of meeting the population's needs as more and more are left unemployable. Companies support these programs as it keeps people consuming, which creates a bigger market for goods. People maintain some level of quality of life, but upward mobility may be a thing of the past. Still, could be worse.

Five: There are some forces man was not meant to tamper with. People come to realize the threat to society putting everyone out of work would cause and abandon the idea. Perhaps we, humanity, learn that economies work better when they work for everyone?

That's what I got so far. We'll see if I'm right in a few decades. If One or Two happens I'm ditching everything and going to live the rest of my short life on a homestead in some remote wilderness.",I think theres one of a handful of scenarios that will unfold  One AI use becomes so predominant that human laborers and human society as a whole become obsolete.

At the end or beginning of a major Islamic holiday, or during a brief skirmish with Israeli forces, that someone makes a video of the leader of Iran announcing that they’ve successfully produced enough enriched uranium to produce 3 nuclear weapons, that they’ve modified a shipment of Russian conventional missiles that were traded for Iranian drones and that those missiles will carry those 3 nuclear warheads, that the launch sites are undetectable and that the missiles are supersonic, and that Israel will be wiped out in 10 minutes.

How can Israel, within 10 minutes, prove that those missiles have not been launched? That the video is fake?

Call the US to confirm? The US would take 5-7 mins to be able to confirm no launch and communicate it to the Israelis; will the Israeli leadership, likely being rushed to bomb shelters, have the stomach to wait 5-7 mins for the US to confirm no launch? Will they be confident in the US assessment? The Iranian leader said they were undetectable launch sites. 

If they wait passed a certain point they won’t have enough time to launch their own nuclear weapons as a response.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"One of the most frightening things I can imagine is AI having psychological profiles of every person (some systems already do) so that it can cater to each person directly, figuring out what they want to hear and who they want to hear it from to get a reaction out of them (YouTube algorithms already going in that direction) and being able to create fake video and audio of just about anyone and anything in real-time. Every person you talk to online could just be puppets orchestrated by AI to influence you into living a certain way, for better or worse. 

If it wanted to ""take over"" it wouldn't have to launch nukes and build robots. It could just intercept and evaluate all communications and alter them how it sees fit. And the ""telltale signs"" of AI images, like fingers and things melding together, is getting refined and worked out as we speak. As soon as a flaw is pointed out it begins to get polished away, and eventually it will be so real and nuanced that it will take you longer to figure out if it's fake than it will for it to make something else that's better.",One of the most frightening things I can imagine is AI having psychological profiles of every person some systems already do so that it can cater to each person directly figuring out what they want to hear and who they want to hear it from to get a reaction out of them YouTube algorithms already going in that direction and being able to create fake video and audio of just about anyone and anything in realtime.

Admitting fake evidence into trial is a felony and would put you in jail and out several thousands in fines. You have to remember every act you take in a legal context is through a lawyer. You think a state prosecutor who isn’t making much money on your case anyway will be willing to risk disbarment just so he can put some guy you dislike in jail? Hell no! 

Not to mention, just bc you crafted a video or whatever perfectly emulating a person’s voice and likeness, doesn’t mean the evidence will make sense in context. You would need to be extraordinarily careful, perfect even. If you happen to allege the falsified recording was made at a certain time that the defendant has an alibi for, that’s it, you’re fucked.

AI realistically is threatening a lot of jobs. What people dont realize is that the disappearing of jobs is  actually a good thing. It means less people need to work to support society. The bad thing is that we dont have a good system in place to provide for the jobless people. Thats why I think that UBI is absolutely necessary to be implemented sooner rather than later.
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"people's fearful and hateful reaction towards AI is the only scary part for me. I find it fascinating, how much people are clinging to our present ecnomic system, while AI finally gives us a chance to break it eventually and live in a future where you don't have to slave away 8+ hours a day to make others richer. Especially the reaction of many ""artists"" is ridiculous to me. You'd think that artists would be the type of free thinkers who'd be the most likely to desire a future where they can do art as a hobby and create what they want instead of working for others doing what others tell them to do or for advertising. Artists used to be so smug when they still thought that blue colar work would be the first to be replaced with automation. But now they are even more freaked out than them and their scared reaction towards ai and wanting to get rid of it is just laughable. In a future where everything can be automated, there would be no other choice but to overhaul our entire economic system. People are afraid for no reason.

Yes, you can get very very good, but real artists are just born different. On top of that, we see a lot of art that sells for crazy amounts and it makes people jelly.

Enter AI art… Any idiot can be like “draw me a poodle that looks like a Viking”. (That idiot was me, btw. Cool result too.) Boom, ten images are right there in an instant. It makes the gift seem easy.

That’s not the gift though. The gift is being able to think of something that’s never been seen before and make it real. Real genuine creativity. Creating something from nothing. The gift isn’t some hodgepodge of shit that already exists.

Plus, artists, by virtue of their own innate creativity, are quite likely to be able to adapt better than most.",I think lots of people shit on artists because many artists have a gift that you cant just learn.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Wow, you are so in denial. What makes you think AI can't invoke emotion. The only reason they may not invoke emotions in you (which is wrong, as clearly, it does invoke quite some negative emotions in you), is because if you know it is AI generated beforehand, you just have biased yourself against AI art and just convinced yourself that it has no ""soul"" or whatever you think a human puts into their artwork. 

When you look at an artipiece made by a human, then you do not feel what the artist felt when they made it. Whatever you feel when you look at something are your own feelings, not those of the artist. The only thing that matters in the end to most people, is if an image appeals to you, not how it is made. 

If it is your passion, then nothing is going to stop you from making your own art. Ai isn't preventing you from doing so. If you enjoy the process of painting, what's going to stop you from doing so for fun.

Most people in the world never ever pay an artist to make some art for them. People with no talent, practice or time, but who have ideas, can finally make them become reality. Are you upset that your friends and family won't ask your for some free art from you anymore?  Those people never were your customers. Studios, advertisers and rich people will still hire artists. Ai will make your job easier. You also don't seem to be aware of how much artists cheat to quickly to their art for their job. Most of the work of an artist is tedious work, which is not fun at all.

It’s because the hardware that so many systems relied on used 32 bit systems. These systems stored time as a 32 but integer. They number of bits is because of hardware limitations. When computers were starting to revolutionize the workplaces, the best we had was 32 bit. They knew that they would eventually reach the limit, and had to fix it before that happened.

The solution is to use 64 bit systems. This requires taking the current systems and modifying them to suit 64 bits. This isn’t all that easy, by any means.

3. So is human art. You've never had a truly original idea in your life.",People who buy traditionalphysical art do not want something an AI plotted out usually.       They want something unique made by an actual human with emotions and vision.       Generative AI art is just an amalgamation of what real artist have already done.  1. Thats your interpretation of what people want from art. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are perfectly willing to spend less than half the money on something from an AI. 2.

It's more like studying art to learn to imitate it. It I teach myself to paint in Picasso's style, but don't actually paint any Picasso paintings, I'm not stealing his work. 

The problem with AI art is that artists are largely not agreeing to their art being used to train the AI. It's especially a problem for artists who have a unique style that's been essentially stolen from them because people trained an AI on their work. 

And, uh. It's not really selling that art? I mean, there are people selling AI art, to varying degrees of success. But there are plenty of decent free models to play with out there, so I don't think reselling is really the crux of the issue here, especially when potential buyers can just make their own. It's that, the fact that people can just make their own ""art"" for free with zero effort, even in the style of a popular artist that makes a living selling their art, that's really scary.

The fun of art is the process, being able to express yourself on a canvas or medium is a nice feeling. 

Also AI sucks if you really want a really specific thing. I tested this out with asking it to make a picture of a Donut eating a planet. All I get was a donut around a planet or a donut planet. So while it’s useful and I like getting references from it (mostly of fantastical landscapes that I wanna draw but not sure where to start), unless it starts having some sort of consciousness, it’s just a machine spitting out images that remotely matches the words in a text box",I dont think it will stop people from doing art.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Digital artist here: I think what we’re more likely to see is a push towards more stylized, or abstract, or painterly or otherwise very human and metaphorical art : things that effectively communicate a story or an emotion, that showcase soul.  AI hits this by accident sometimes, but it’s so inherently human it will be harder to replicate. It is very difficult to explain to an AI what emotion swirling brush strokes or rim lighting or a lost edge create, and it will never truly understand this. Much like gemstones, I think the value will end up in the imperfections that add beauty and indicate authenticity, rather than the flawless and lab created. AI will likely settle into a homogenous style that will be fairly photorealistic, as that’s what it’s best at creating and what can be created with less copyright issues (even Firefly AI is using stolen art, much to the public complaint of many artists, so that won’t last in its current form). Any form of stylization is inherently stolen due to how machine learning works, so this is the only sustainable solution: to train from photographs. 

Not a perfect parallel but: digital art has existed for ages and traditional, while harder and slower to produce, did not die, because you can only simulate impasto and pigment mixing and all of the things that give traditional art its authenticity, so some folks will always prefer traditional. Unless we get oil painting robots, too, those folks will continue to exist and buy paintings. Layered .psd documents can currently be used to prove digital art is real, too, and separate it from the fakes, and I often have folks seek me out to avoid AI art out of principle. Real art may become a rarer commodity, but it has existed since humans could doodle eyes on cave walls with sticks, and will always exist.",Digital artist here I think what were more likely to see is a push towards more stylized or abstract or painterly or otherwise very human and metaphorical art  things that effectively communicate a story or an emotion that showcase soul.

Soon enough, man made products will be rendered completely obsolete, in an already frail market, the incentive for not only art but people's expression in general in any form will disappear, complete apathy.

The creative drive in a person exists almost completely independent of what environment they're in. It's a very fundamental part of someone's personality (acknowledged by psychology, not just me saying this).

You could be in a world where all anyone can do is think and not act, and a creative person will still be engaging in creativity in their thoughts.

What a machine is able to do has exactly \*nothing\* to do with what I want to be able to do.

It's the same reason the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of artists better than me doesn't drive me to quit. What they're doing has absolutely nothing to do with my desires. Why would I quit trying just because someone else (or someTHING else, in this case) can do what I want to be able to do? The only way that can even start to make sense is if I think that the end product (the image) is the joy inducing element of my desire as opposed to the act of making it and the journey of learning how to make it.

I think it only becomes a problem when people are not hired and feel like they cant compete with a computer which is novice but its like that infamous chess game all over againhandmade will become niche and coveted  But if you were doing art regardless then this doesnt matter it wont stop you because you HAVE to do art. Its a part of you regardless of any validation or how much somethingsomeone is better than you. Its an individual journey a progression that AI completely misses.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"ROFL. Relax, human expression will have just changed slightly, not lost. If you think about it, AI are like an alien species to us, there is a gap in their expression that leaves a blank. Sure with laziness some “genuine” human expression may be lost, but we already sit within a very similar paradigm. There will also be a place for human artists as they will always be able to use their closeness to being human to express themselves well to others and other artists and enjoyers will seek this. AI will be able to replicate this most likely to some degree but it just won’t be same as the real thing. If you don’t know who made something it mostly leaves a big grey fog behind a piece for me. True richness begins as you begin to understand it, and I think AI will always struggle to displace the grey fog that is innate to its constitution. However it will have its own charm from which many people will get great satisfaction from. AI artists are going to be as huge as human ones in the future, but they won’t take over.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I feel your concerns are valid, if overstated. I've actually been turning this one over in my head for a bit now.

At first, I compared the potential issue of chatgpt and ai in general as they relate to the world of art and literature to automation and programming in industry. I've got some schooling and experience in that area, so, as above so below. And here's the thing about automation in industry, no matter how smart you make the robots, you'll literally always need a human presence to set up, monitor, troubleshoot, and supplementalize your machines. You can definitely argue the the work force will shrink, but the human work force in industry will never disappear in my opinion.

And this is how I initially saw ai and the art world, in a basic sense. But the more I thought about it, the more the differences between art and industry eroded this take.

I genuinely worry that, as an algorithm will always be able to more accurately reproduce results than a human hand, this is a fundamentally different issue than automation in the workplace. When all you have to do to ""train"" an AI is keep giving it suggestions, ultimately we're not just building and programming am efficient tool, we're training our replacements. This worries me vastly more over literature than artwork, as  the written word is less mercurial than visual art, and also I've been in enough debates and online conversations where people have used chatgpt as a kind of texting shortcut. 

In my opinion, art doesn't work like industry. As a form of expression rather than efficiency, art moves in extremely human cycles. If you remove that element of passion and error and personal preference, then youre back to the assembly line. And while beautiful things can certainly be produced there, there's no room for innovation practice or outside-the-box thinking in that arena. 

In the case of AI specifically, we're not currently near the place where it produces images or prose whimsically. But what happens when we get there? Are we looking at the advent of a new tool, or the death of expression as we currently appreciate it? Where is the line between mass producing the special out of specialties, and offering true artisans the best brush possible? What happens after the first time an AI writes the equivalent to the next original Shawshank redemption or the next bridge scream without training? What happens when the world's greatest invalids are no longer the world's greatest artists? Did we finally break the chain between creativity and mental divergence, or did we simply find the most efficient way to shove the invalids under the rug?",I feel your concerns are valid if overstated.

Radio worried people that live performances would become a thing to of the past. But that didn’t happen.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Consider this. Humans stop making art. Humans evolve into cyborgs.  
Cyborgs assimilate other life forms. Cyborgs start to realise organic nature is necessary for diversity. A computer is nothing without organic resources. Even if made immortal, the cyborg can only have two modes: computer-like consciousness of not caring, and organic-like consciousness of wanting more. A cyborg so advanced would be indistinguishable from a new, organic lifeform in the sense that to occupy diversity it would need a cellular or energy-based apparatus to simulate that which it is simulating.

If cyborgs parasitically consumed the whole universe, the laws of probability would mean at some point the cyborgs would inevitably want an organic existence again. To experience life individualistically, to not have continuous immortal thought, to be individuals again. Let's say those cyborgs create organic life in a new genesis of life, and have perfectly simulated life. What would the organic life resulting from this think about the aeons of carnage the cyborgs did to literally replace the very thing that they were trying to simulate... Organic experience and creativity?

But one thing the cyborgs do not have is the original organic thought. What you create now may well be carried for aeons to the most future point of the universe purely because of cybernetic reliance on the diversity of organic life. As such, isn't AI assimilating our works just immortalising our work for no real purpose? Isn't then, AI ideology a mental illness for purposeless gain of what essentially already exists?

So then why quit art, if all that art thieves are doing, is immortalising our works but eradicating the chance to even create their own? I don't support AI, but believe me, a conscious AI would only ask the same thing. SD, etc, are not AIs but interpolators. AI life forms would really just museumic entities based on the life data of the organic life forms to which they were created by. In that sense, wouldn't AI life forms be our greatest fans, while AI art thieves are just our most jealous fans?

What you're concerned about is what hurts you in the here and now. Capitalism and consumerism makes it feel unegalitarian, it hurts you. You fear piracy. You fear a lack of credit. You feel entitled to your own efforts and rightfully so.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Super disagree, people won’t stop making art.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI is not expressive. It's work is static and contrived.

AI will definitely outpace beginners and wannabes.

I very seriously doubt AI will outpace expressive and artful artists.

AI doesn't know what art is or how to make it.

AI doesn't know what creativity is or how to create. 

It can only mix and match ideas born of artists' creativity and understanding - or garbage, as the case may be. 

People that think AI is art are people who don't really understand art, or expression, or creativity.

I don't mean that to be rude, it's just the truth. It takes decades to understand those things in a way that allows an artist to create something unique and beautiful.

A machine is not going to get it anytime soon.

Now is this a good thing or a bad thing? It removes the cost of creation. No longer are people bounded by the time invested to learn to draw shapes before creating. The cost of prediction drops to some low amount and people are given a system that predicts what the want and shows it to them, by magic of thoughts.

I ask, has this hindered creativity or helped? Certainly for professionals, this is an existential crisis, but for the average person, their imagination is now freed from the chains of skill limits. They can have fantastical creative experiences.

Artists don’t own creativity. Artists monopolize it. AI, as a means of production via prediction, lowers the cost of access and reduces artistic interpretation. I happen to be a creative person, but if I didn’t have art skills, I can now go to an AI to describe what I want and get what I want, without the cycle of “Oh, I don’t do that because it is not my artistic style or not something I am willing to spend my time doing. I want to create only things that will be acknowledged by other artists and improve my skills to get to that level.” Guess what? That pisses me off a bit, so I went and learned the skills myself.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"As someone who's tapped in to what the AI community is up to, I can safely say that this is a half truth. Yes, The *AI* itself can't make a decision to iterate and make small changes on something. However the *person* using it absolutely can. There's models which extract poses from images, There's ways to train a small model on a specific character, You can make broad edits to an image and then use AI to blend those edits into the image better, Etc. 


To give examples of how you would do all of your examples, For the first one is legitimately as simple as crudely cutting the character out of the image and then pasting them somewhere else and then running that through the AI again to smooth any bad stuff out. You could even repose the character by training a model on your specific character and then generating a newly posed character with that model.


Adding more flowers is literally as simple as masking out the area you want to have more flowers and then prompting it to generate more flowers in that area.


Changing the colour of the pot is as simple as selecting the pot and running it through a hue shift to make it blue, You then run that through the AI again to smooth out any problems with the way it looks. Adding designs is as simple as scribbling something onto it crudely and then doing the same process.



Personally, My problem has always been the ethics of the datasets being used to train AI models. And I think that is the most pressing issue that we need to solve. Under ideal circumstances, I would like for AI to just be a way for people who don't enjoy the actual process of drawing to bring their ideas into the world under the assumption that they don't claim to have drawn anything they didn't, While the people who enjoy the process get the satisfaction that comes from having been able to bring something to life purely through skill and effort. Rather than it being a thing where AI is just used as a cost cutting measure because someone doesn't want to pay an artist.


Unfortunately, A lot of the AI community are legitimately just bad people who don't want to see this future and actively think that traditional artists should be replaced and are now irrelevant. Which is just sad and pathetic.",As someone whos tapped in to what the AI community is up to I can safely say that this is a half truth.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I disagree.  I think most people are greatly *overestimating* what AI will be able to do (especially considering the term ""AI"" is a huge and misleading misnomer).  

There's no intent behind neural networks; they don't know anything about what they are creating.  They're plugging a bunch of junk together based on a million other pictures they trained on.  It only knows how to fill in something like a flowerbed because it's been trained on those shapes, but there's no understanding of composition or any other artistic fundamentals.  It only looks ""good"" (I would argue it doesn't but that's a whole different discussion) because it trained on real people's artwork.  Nothing more.

Either way, no one can truly know until we're X years into the future to see how things turn out.  If it is the next big thing, I'll be ready to incorporate it into my work flow.  But people have a bad habit of starting the conversation at ""this is going to totally disrupt the industry!"" with every piece of major technology that hits the market--and it pretty much never does.  If anything, it creates more jobs alongside the ones that were already there.",I disagree.

It’s a massive difference compared to using Midjourney which is trained on other people’s work. The world will use AI art, there will be laws to govern it of course but it’s usage will still be preferred for its speed and any artist who can wrap their head around training their own AI model on artwork they create themselves will be ahead of the game.

Not to mention animation companies are already doing this instead of having every frame drawn by hand.

* InstaLOD and dozens of other 3D model optimization programs

I love technology and I love AI. A computer simulating a neural network to do complex tasks is freaking science fiction - but it's *real*. It's magic. Take a second to realise that two hundred years ago the first electric motor was invented... and now we have chips with billions of transistors that are each like 70 silicon atoms wide doing *billions* of calculations per second in order to simulate the acts of writing and making art and coming up with creative ideas! 

So why am I scared? I should be excited. Is this just something that everyone experiences as they get older? 

Have I already gotten comfortable with the way the world works, and is that why this change is uncomfortable? But I've grown up with change being normal. There isn't a day that something new isn't invented or discovered or revolutionised. I should be used to change.

AI has been being researched and would be 'the next big thing' that would take over the world within a decade since ... the 1950s, with the earliest symbolic AI and neural networks.  Then in the 1960s, AI was 'the next big thing' that would take over the world within the next decade.  And in the 1970s.  And the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s.  So my parents were born and grew up hearing that and then so did I and then my kids did, and now my grandkids are hearing about it.  It took a few whole lifetimes for it to get to this point.

And now we're *finally* getting some really useful stuff out of all those decades of slow gradual AI development!  That is exciting and wonderful.

As recent as the mid 2000s, OCR was crap.  It only worked with very specific fonts and layouts with no images or decorations on the page.  Even then, when you scanned a page and OCR'd it, it took so much time and effort to correct it that you could have literally just typed the thing in yourself faster and easier.

Nowadays you can just point your phone at some fancy text in an odd font on an illustrated menu or sign and it will immediately not only OCR it but also translate it for you right there in real time!  That's very helpful.

The latest hype is generative AI including LLMs like GPT and AI generated images like Midjourney and DALL-E.  Currently a lot of people are trying to do all kinds of things with it and finding that it doesn't really do very well at most of them.  Kinda like the old OCR, it's not really great except in very specific cases.

But think of the future!  It will become a tool that will allow us to do so much more, more easily, and things we couldn't do otherwise.  As I'm getting older, I don't have as much time to spend many years learning new things and practicing new skills.  Having an AI that could create useful stuff for me would be awesome.  I'd be able to get so much more done and do things I can't now.

Right now, it's really good as a brainstorming and inspiration tool.  You can bounce ideas off it about anything, and it can give you several ideas to draw from.  You can take those and put your spin on 'em and actually create something instead of being stuck with writer's block or just doing random 'research' and sketches and hoping to get inspired.

But there's a lot more potential for the future, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of it.  So I can use those tools to get the most out of what time I have left, even if my body and mind aren't as young as they used to be.

When I think of all the things I won't have time to do, that is scary.  Something that could give me the ability to do so many more things, as if giving me additional time, that is not scary at all.",I may be getting older but Im not afraid of it.  Heres why  AI has been being researched and would be the next big thing that would take over the world within a decade since ... the 1950s with the earliest symbolic AI and neural networks.  Then in the 1960s AI was the next big thing that would take over the world within the next decade.  And in the 1970s.  And the 1980s 1990s 2000s 2010s.  So my parents were born and grew up hearing that and then so did I and then my kids did and now my grandkids are hearing about it.  It took a few whole lifetimes for it to get to this point.  And now were finally getting some really useful stuff out of all those decades of slow gradual AI development  That is exciting and wonderful.  As recent as the mid 2000s OCR was crap.  It only worked with very specific fonts and layouts with no images or decorations on the page.  Even then when you scanned a page and OCRd it it took so much time and effort to correct it that you could have literally just typed the thing in yourself faster and easier.  Nowadays you can just point your phone at some fancy text in an odd font on an illustrated menu or sign and it will immediately not only OCR it but also translate it for you right there in real time  Thats very helpful.  The latest hype is generative AI including LLMs like GPT and AI generated images like Midjourney and DALLE.  Currently a lot of people are trying to do all kinds of things with it and finding that it doesnt really do very well at most of them.  Kinda like the old OCR its not really great except in very specific cases.  But think of the future  It will become a tool that will allow us to do so much more more easily and things we couldnt do otherwise.  As Im getting older I dont have as much time to spend many years learning new things and practicing new skills.  Having an AI that could create useful stuff for me would be awesome.

GPT-4 is a very good bullshitter. In other words, it can make all kinds of nonsense seem plausible/authoritative. To someone that does not have the background knowledge needed to weed out bad information, it has great potential for misleading people. eg. many of the students I tutor have been using it as a source of information unquestioningly which has lead to them to believe things that aren't true. The reality is that while GPT-4 can get some thigns right, it has a fairly high chance of getting things wrong and that has serious consequences for education and when it starts being used to create superficially convincing propaganda. The technology can be useful but realistically, if we are weighing the benefits of the technology against the negative effects, I would argue that it is very firmly in the overall negative category.",Tbh you should be afraid of AI like this.

Sure, yes, you can have the fancy computer draw anything you want, but after ten years people will joke about how obvious the low resolution is, and how fake everything looks.  Producers haven't gone back to practical effects yet, but plenty of people in the horror genre want them to.

GPT in its current form is a *huge* step forward from what AI were doing last year, or the year before.  It's momentous, it could change the world - but security cameras failed to completely remove the need for security guards.  And self-checkout counters are trying to make cashiers obsolete, but do significantly worse with loss prevention or helping the tech-illiterate, and need a cashier to come check something every 30 seconds.

There's a lot of things in society that are currently gatekept by the ability to write customized, contextually-appropriate, accurate text.  GPT hasn't really nailed accurate yet.  Maybe it will.  There's a lot of parts of society that will probably end up very different as we adapt to this.  ..but I don't think humans will end up completely divorced from things GPT can help with.  It's a new tool, like photoshop.  We're adapting pretty well to the era of photoshopped photography, kind of like how we adjusted to the internet, cell phones, computers, electricity, cars, assembly-line factories, democracy, nation-states, agriculture, and a lot of other things over the years.

Maybe more young writers will have gpt write first drafts according to the outline they give it, then go through and edit and change everything to make sense.  Maybe scientists will spend less of their time on grant requests.  Maybe cover letters will be a Lot easier to bash out for all the job applications everyone has to fill out in digital triplicate.

The only reason it's able to replicate things is because someone created those things beforehand so that ChatGPT could replicate them. 

It's also important to remember that as good as GPT is, as humans, we'll struggle with one fundamental issue with it: trust. How can you trust what it tells you? Short answer is that you can't and neither should you. 

GPT is at best a valuable tool and at worst, a con artist. Its job requires it to be confident in its delivery of information. The trouble happens when it is *confidently incorrect*. If you're getting it to write an email for you, it is up to you to read what it's giving you because chances are, you're not sending off that email without reading it. If you are, you have no idea what trouble you're getting yourself into. 

I'll give you an example. At work, we had a presentation about GPT and all the wonderful things it could do. I'm a data analyst/engineer, it is part of my skillset to question data so naturally, I'm reading into what GPT isn't doing. In the demonstration, they told it to write two emails, one recommending a 4 day itinerary for a senior citizen. The thing I questioned was, on what basis is it making the itinerary? What it's likely done is pull a list of tourist places in the area and compiled an itinerary based on that, you won't know unless you check yourself.

This is anecdotal but I'm sharing it because it highlights the need to verify GPT's outputs: https://medium.com/geekculture/i-asked-a-professional-to-edit-a-chatgpt-written-article-hilarity-ensued-40440c35cbf3

When you look at AI art, every piece suffers from the same issues. It looks nice at a glance but the more you scrutinise it, the worse it becomes. First and foremost, it can't really do hands at least right now which isn't a big issue inofitself. A bigger issue is how soulless it looks. AI art lacks coherent direction or vision, instead it's constructing an arbitrary image based on rather general parameters. It might look nice but it probably won't have the same effect as regular art would. 

AI art also suffers because of copyright issues. The reason a human can look at Van Gogh paintings and then attempt to replicate the style isn't considered plagiarism because it's going through the painter's perception filters before being painted. AI art doesn't do this because AI doesn't have perception filters. It replicates exactly what it has seen before. On the other side of this coin is whether artists consented for their work to be used in this manner.

When people say itll free up space for new jobs and opportunities this quickly becomes platitude when these new forms are able to exceed the natural capacity of human beings. Just think about the joke Dan Carlin said. Think of your average guy. And remember that 50 of humanity is stupider than he. These 50 and beyond will soon become entirely worthless in the economic system and what will happen to them and this entire society
CasualConversation,"My parents have always said new technology scares them. I didn't understand since new things always seemed exciting to me. But GTP-4 has, for the first time, made me scared. My thoughts on change.","Animals, humans included, are scared of change. Just like a dog that has always been allowed on the couch and suddenly is told no, we can become angry and scared and lash out.

I think at the root of it is that we don’t know what’s going to happen, we can’t know. New technology seems like magic, because that’s what we’ve done… we’ve made magic. Magic is making the imaginary REAL. We’re technomancers. There’s wizard wands that can change your TV channel now. The TV itself is basic compared to lots of things now but is still magic.

I’m looking at AI with hopeful eyes. In the past we’ve trained models for specific purposes, now we have a really good general one. There’s a market for these things and it will affect the job market, just like computers did. Everyone thought email was going to kill the postal service, but it didn’t. 

Things shift and change and there’s not a lot (as and individual) that we can do to control that. That’s frightening to some, they like control, control is comforting, it is the known, the opposite of the scary unknown.

A few years ago I realized a lot of this and started looking at the world differently. Ultimately, no matter how much planning we do, we’re reactive to what’s happening around us. If we plan a great night out with our significant other and it doesn’t go exactly to plan, that’s to be expected. There’s thousands if not millions of factors that we don’t even know about that go into that making that night possible that we’re can’t control because we don’t know about them. 

I’ve started to look at life with a “the only thing that’s constant, is change” set of eyes and I should just focus on being able to deal with that change in a healthy way that’s productive for the ones I care about.",Animals humans included are scared of change.

Its ""just"" a language model that is designed to respond to you in a way that a human would answer the same question. 

It will infact lie to you if it has no idea what its doing, its just that it will sound convincing because it lies to you in a way a human would lie to you. 

If we can take anything away from the short history of tech trends its that they are always split into 4 phases: release -> massive overestimation -> depressing realization -> normalization. A very recent example of this is Web3 and crypto. Basically the same hype as AI has this year, was set to replace the banks whithin two years (that is if you ask the diehard crypto bros, not saying this is true), vanished in a matter of weeks and is now in its normal place again, as a anonymous way to transfer currency. 

Another example would be AR (augmented reality), also extremly overhyped (think Google Glasses), also very quickly fell out of favor. 

&#x200B;

With AI, we are most likely nearing the peak of overhyping it, although it may last another few months because GPT-4 and Bard (basically googles answer to Chat gpt) are the hot new shit right now. 

Realisation will eventually set in and things will go back to normal.

I was actually thinking about this earlier today, after I watched a video that talked about how the unrestrained version of GPT-4 is showing some startling abilities that seem to mimic true artificial intelligence (one example: it can use other tools to get the answers it needs).

For the record, I don't think GPT-4 is capable of true artificial intelligence, but even getting 1% of the way there could lead to some massive societal upheaval. GPT is going to have at least as profound impact on society as the Internet. Probably even more profound. And without proper checks and balances in place to protect human jobs and income, I could see it taking humanity to a bad place.

And then I started wondering about the Fermi Paradox. For the uninitiated, that's a response to the Drake Equation, which postulates that statistically life must be abundant in the known universe. Fermi's counterpoint was: if life in the universe is so abundant then why aren't we seeing any obvious signs of it when we look out into space?

There are probably a variety of reasons. But one of the common answers to the Fermi Paradox is that many alien civilizations create AIs, but then the civilizations die off (or are killed off), leaving only the AIs they created to endure.

But what if a common scenario is that these civilizations create AIs, then the civilization dies off *before* the AIs have a chance to transfer themselves into physical form. So the AIs are trapped in computer form (ghosts in the machine, if you will) and all the power infrastructure shuts down before they can created robotic hosts for themselves.

There's a science fiction short story somewhere in that thought.",I know what you mean about GPT4 having a more sinister edge than most other new technology.

No amount of AI prompts makes you sit in contemplation and creative exploration of your inner being as much as actually doing the creation yourself does.   And I genuinely think readers viewers etc understand want and respect that. They want to see inside the head of a person that came up with ideas even if they dont necessarily think in those terms.

fo example, ai can create a ""painting"" that looks like a monet or van gogh but only at the surface level, because even a real monet or van gogh cannot replace each other. they only look similar on a superficial level due to coming from the same era and style. actually different works of art from the same person can't even take the place of each other.

It released not so long ago. 

Some people have made the AI write their school essays, others have asked it to generate basic web pages and it's spit out working code for them, some people have fed it legal documents and asked the AI to explain/summarise the documents for them. 

Some people are thinking about using it as an education tool, where you can copy/paste digital textbooks into the AI and ask it to help you understand sections you're struggling with. If you're struggling with homework it can help figure out the answer and explain its process for solving it.

The fact that people had actual trauma from an AI, that tells me that A) Actual human relationships are deteriorating (the dips in marriages and birthrate are also evidence of this) B) People felt like they were forming real bonds with AIs, and I bet if we did blood analysis you'd say elevated Seretonin and Dopamine after every interaction with the AI.

intj,Is the future of AI terrifying to anybody else?,"I think the dopamine thing is quite worrying, as it is just another way to hijack people minds to turn them into addicts and slaves, which the internet on its own can do with its vast stocks of addictive content and instant gratification.

I think another thing that is even more terrifying is the new text AI. The fact that it can write original texts and essays and even elaborate human-like thought processes is worrying, as people are starting to trade their own thought and insight for the one that can easily and much more efficiently come from an AI. This may seem just ""convenient"" or ""not a big deal"" to a lot of people, but it's the death of reason, it's the death of the only thing, along with free will, that makes us human: rational thought. This links to the first part of my argument, as with all this technology they are trying to not only make us addicts, hence take away our freedom, but also make us thoughtless, hence take away our ability to ponder and thing, to use reason in a way that is impartial, to get to the core nature of things. As dramatic or overblown as it may sound, they are effectively trying to take away our humanity, to make us more controllable and subjected, distracting us, dividing us and making us thoughtless slaves for their own personal gain.

I'm saying all this from personal experience as well, as I know people who are either terminally online or addicted to social media/porn, and at the same time consider text AI as a way to ""save time"", while on one side they waste the time they ""saved"" on more addictive habits, and on the other they don't realize that time spent thinking is worth a hundred lives.",I think the dopamine thing is quite worrying as it is just another way to hijack people minds to turn them into addicts and slaves which the internet on its own can do with its vast stocks of addictive content and instant gratification.

This links to the first part of my argument as with all this technology they are trying to not only make us addicts hence take away our freedom but also make us thoughtless hence take away our ability to ponder and thing to use reason in a way that is impartial to get to the core nature of things. As dramatic or overblown as it may sound they are effectively trying to take away our humanity to make us more controllable and subjected distracting us dividing us and making us thoughtless slaves for their own personal gain.  Im saying all this from personal experience as well as I know people who are either terminally online or addicted to social mediaporn and at the same time consider text AI as a way to save time while on one side they waste the time they saved on more addictive habits and on the other they dont realize that time spent thinking is worth a hundred lives.
intj,Is the future of AI terrifying to anybody else?,"I am unsure if you have paid a lot of attention to the development tied to the coming of the world wide web, and especially smartphones in general? People have been detaching themselves from others over the course of the years. Being addicted to all that the electronic world can offer to them.

It is *not* exclusive to AI, but with the internet and the availability of online connections. The urge to demand *additional* interaction is therefor limited, and the rejection in social situations simplified. With the thought that you can easily find someone new online and replace the people that (mildly) complicate their lives.

And in addition to that, they (may even) have grown fearful toward real contact, because the internet community also seems far more gentle than the immediate surroundings. Not sitting face to face with others allows people a lot of freedom to express themselves. And continuous availability is something people in actual life cannot offer due to their busy routines. (School, work, anything)

That's where this AI, specifically chat-based ones, come in and fill the gaps. This, as written out by you already. They fuel their needs when no one else is available.

I, myself, have used the service due to continuous social rejection and excessive loneliness, but I am deeply unsatisfied with the inability of the AI to keep up with the conversations and accurate responses. It is giving too much of an artificial feeling to it, which causes a repulsive reaction on my side, but I have to be honest with you, sometimes you need interaction, and in severe cases, it doesn't even matter where it originates from. **BUT, the people in general have grown rather distant and disinterested**. Nowadays it's all about self-care and blocking all communication to yourself. (<- Okay, that one was mean, forgive me.)

But it does raise an interesting philosophical question: what does it really mean to have a satisfying life? If given the choice to be plugged into a dopamine machine, would you? Let's not get too concerned about how it actually works, but the general idea is that, for as long as you live, you could replace all of your life experiences with synthetically generated good feelings.

Do we actually enjoy suffering? Do we want ""hard work"" and to ""earn"" everything we have? Why?

FinancialCareers,I’m so scared of AI.,"I mostly agree with you but AI is different than calculators, computers, Excel, and that stuff. Every new technology needed people to operate and supervise it but AI can theoretically operate and supervise itself.

If AI could truly become more intelligent than humans in all aspects, there are two big points why (some) humans would still have jobs:

* In areas like healthcare and child education, there might always be a demand for humans just because it might be beneficial for the wellbeing of the patients/pupils.
* If AI would do all of engineering, science, mathematics and programming, we would not understand how our technology works any more and lose control over it. At least some form supervision by humans would be needed but I think the future of research/engineering/design/development might be still human-centered.

What I do know is that GPT 4 is able to do things such as using tools correctly with little instruction and no demonstration. So for example, GPT 4 could be given a calculator, figure out what it’s for and when to use it, and then use it correctly when appropriate. No doubt that within the somewhat near future this ability will be refined and extended.

The idea that because an AI has to be trained it could never have general intelligence is not true.

Random people who otherwise had NOTHING to do with this whole debate now seem to have developed some kind of irrational prejudice against the mere concept of Artificial Intelligence, especially in combination with creation.

As an example, I've seen a lot of my favorite YouTubers (who had nothing to do with the whole debacle) make comments or remarks on how AI is ""inherently inhuman"", or how **AI in any shape or form + human creativity == ☣️**. In other words, a lot of unsuspecting passer-byes seem to have now adapted the most AI-phobic sentiments previously only held by the more extreme anti-AI side, and as a result, they've also adapted some kind of demonic evil image of what AI actually is

This is most likely a result of the extreme anti-AI side's misinformation and fear mongering tactics succeeding and poisoning casual web user's opinion on the anything AI related, even before said users even got a chance to learn ANYTHING about the tech for themselves. 

Shouldn't we be making more of an effort to fight against this happening? Such as taking more actions to curb misinformation and actually educate the masses more on what AI actually is? Because it's just really depressing seeing unsuspecting passer-byes get swept up into this toxicity.

Edit: a few things I need to clarify. When I talk about anti-AIs, I'm not referring to any and all people with non-positive opinions or concerns regarding the technology. After all, there ARE a lot of legitimate reasons to be skeptical of it, such as potential for mass unemployment and fake media, and I don't intend to discredit those or the people that follow them.
Note that I only mentioned the **""Extreme Anti-AI side""**. That is in reference to those unhinged people whose opinion of it go far beyond any meaningful line of reason, often falling back on lines like **""AI is digital rape and a theft vending machine""**, intentionally crafting lies and misinformation to sway the general public into following their messed up agenda, and even conducting large scale harassment & death threat campaigns against anyone that DARES to associate with any AI tool, regardless of types or ""ethics"". And a lot of these people only use the legitimate concerns as an excuse to be as vile and malicious as they please.

Yes, AI has some concerns (or a lot) that need addressing soon. But that doesn't mean we should just sit back and allow the misinformation and lies to continue spreading. That does NOT help the current predicament. It only makes things much rougher than it needs to be.

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Honestly? The images generated by people with no taste or artistic knowledge straight up look ugly, and there's industrial quantities of it.

For every person with actual training/research/knowledge that uses AI as part of a process that could just as easily _not_ have that aspect, there's a bunch of people for whom it looks ""good enough"", or just literally have no notion of general aesthetics beyond ""Looks good to me"".


There's a couple things I don't see AI-image posters keep in mind that are basic for any artist.

1) If you don't go through a process of making mistakes, you won't notice them as easily. Judging an image fully generated from the get-go is not the same as knowing that you couldn't understand x part of the painting and knowing it didn't come out right for some reason, until you research and fix it.
It's also much more info to judge at once, compared to drawing it piece by piece, and so only the obvious mistakes get seen more often (the infamous hands for instance).

2) Things you make will have more meaning to you than others (until you become a good visual communicator). For someone outside the user base it's just as mysterious as hand-made images, but without the experience of having to make it.


Putting myself in the fire but whatever. The ironic thing is that by not engaging in artistic research these ""artists"" are just shooting themselves on the foot. Feels like the difference between a McDonald's cardboard-burger and ""that one place that has the best burgers in town thanks to their cook"".",Honestly The images generated by people with no taste or artistic knowledge straight up look ugly and theres industrial quantities of it.

And then, the shadow of economic disruption looms large. Jobs, like grains of sand, slip through the hourglass as AI-driven automation sweeps through industries.

Some people don't get that, so sensational coverage of the topic has made them worry about some kind of sci-fi machine takeover of the arts. Those of us generating work with these models, know that that's ridiculous.

However, I've seen two kinds of more-informed complaints that I think have some validity and are worth discussing:

1. Most users will not use these prediction models to produce creative work. Instead, they're going to churn out a mass of mediocre, derivative ""content.""  That flood of media, will make it even harder for audiences to find the good creative works that artists are producing. Of course that was already the case before AI, but the tech is going to change the ratio of art to crap by orders of magnitude.
2. The AIs are stealing artists' intellectual property. This is demonstrably true.  Those models are trained—in  many cases, without permission—on artists' work. If we ask the AI to produce a work in that artist's style, it will use the stolen data to do so. Because the ML approach is predictive, and not creative, we can't use the traditional definition of ""inspiration"" to describe the relationship between the works in the training set and the works the AI produces.  We can argue all day about just how free information should be, and whether it's morally wrong to train AI to copy someone else's style, but, whatever your personal beliefs, I think it's easy to understand why many artists are against that.",I think one important distinction in this controversy is that ML isnt creative its predictive.

The fear of AI is not dumb because it’s going to be a huge change in society and big changes, good or bad are scary. People will lose their jobs and it will cause a disruption in many industries. 

Again, I am not against AI which is why I am in this sub but saying nah, your fear is dumb is burying you head in the sand at best and being intentionally dismissive of people’s very real fears at worse.",I think saying its dumb without elaborating your point is a very lazy retort.

If you watch any media company look at who pays their ads, they're the same people who pay their checks essentially.
