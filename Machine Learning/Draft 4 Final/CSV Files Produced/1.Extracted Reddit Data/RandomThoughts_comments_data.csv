RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"I think there's one of a handful of scenarios that will unfold:

One: AI use becomes so predominant that human laborers and human society as a whole become obsolete. Billions of unemployables are left to fend for themselves as property and resources fall into the hands of whoever has control over the most machines. Think a feudal world where the only humanity is noble houses tended to by their legions of loyal machine servants.

Two: As automation advances and more and more people become unemployable, a desperate population do whatever it takes to secure their own needs. Crime becomes rampant and our society, the system that allowed the development and production of automation, falls apart. Thus preventing scenario One but resulting in a breakdown of world order.

Three: Automation becomes so readily available that anyone can be their own boss. People quit jobs and start their own businesses with their own team of robots, sometimes right from their own homes. The idea of working your whole life for someone else disappears and the economy transforms into the closest thing to a free market we've had in centuries.

If only. Obviously, whoever had the most money and property beforehand would have a huge economic advantage over everyone else. Could just turn into Scenario One.

Four: Automation replaces labor, but not people. Social programs such as universal basic income become the new means of meeting the population's needs as more and more are left unemployable. Companies support these programs as it keeps people consuming, which creates a bigger market for goods. People maintain some level of quality of life, but upward mobility may be a thing of the past. Still, could be worse.

Five: There are some forces man was not meant to tamper with. People come to realize the threat to society putting everyone out of work would cause and abandon the idea. Perhaps we, humanity, learn that economies work better when they work for everyone?

That's what I got so far. We'll see if I'm right in a few decades. If One or Two happens I'm ditching everything and going to live the rest of my short life on a homestead in some remote wilderness."

At the end or beginning of a major Islamic holiday, or during a brief skirmish with Israeli forces, that someone makes a video of the leader of Iran announcing that they’ve successfully produced enough enriched uranium to produce 3 nuclear weapons, that they’ve modified a shipment of Russian conventional missiles that were traded for Iranian drones and that those missiles will carry those 3 nuclear warheads, that the launch sites are undetectable and that the missiles are supersonic, and that Israel will be wiped out in 10 minutes.

How can Israel, within 10 minutes, prove that those missiles have not been launched? That the video is fake?

Call the US to confirm? The US would take 5-7 mins to be able to confirm no launch and communicate it to the Israelis; will the Israeli leadership, likely being rushed to bomb shelters, have the stomach to wait 5-7 mins for the US to confirm no launch? Will they be confident in the US assessment? The Iranian leader said they were undetectable launch sites. 

If they wait passed a certain point they won’t have enough time to launch their own nuclear weapons as a response.

Time is ticking on a threat that can’t be found.

This is a major issue and right now no one is appreciating the immediacy."

There is nothing inherently special about art made by humans other than the value that we give it for being made by a human. An artist is telling a story with their art, a story that contains their truth. AI is telling a story that contains no truth. Some people value that truth, but what happens when you can’t tell which one is which anymore? They are both great stories.

Throughout my life I have seen illustrators be sidelined as corporations are using cheaper and cheaper ways to make advertisements, book covers for novels, etc. The past year I have argued with those in my field as well as tech bros who say AI art is the same as me learning to draw (it's insulting). I have even been reassured by other artists that AI art won't get rid of artists but here's the facts.

Companies want something that is as cheap as possible that consumers will find acceptable. Not great but acceptable. Quantity over quality. They will lay off artists and use their single person throwing words into a generator that then steals pieces of other people's work.

Automation was meant to make all the back breaking, soul crushing and dangerous work not require humans anymore and I'm all for that. I worked in a factory 2 years ago. What I am not for is automating everything people do to relax and destress and make money from like art, music, writing, etc.

And to do this precisely we need UBI. We need affordable housing. We need to not tie healthcare to your workplace (for USA). 

If you want to do art, learn. Grab a pencil and a sketchbook and observe life. It is marvelous to watch yourself develop. But don't throw words into a generator, steal from other people and claim your work is just as valid as their journey."

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"One of the most frightening things I can imagine is AI having psychological profiles of every person (some systems already do) so that it can cater to each person directly, figuring out what they want to hear and who they want to hear it from to get a reaction out of them (YouTube algorithms already going in that direction) and being able to create fake video and audio of just about anyone and anything in real-time. Every person you talk to online could just be puppets orchestrated by AI to influence you into living a certain way, for better or worse. 

If it wanted to ""take over"" it wouldn't have to launch nukes and build robots. It could just intercept and evaluate all communications and alter them how it sees fit. And the ""telltale signs"" of AI images, like fingers and things melding together, is getting refined and worked out as we speak. As soon as a flaw is pointed out it begins to get polished away, and eventually it will be so real and nuanced that it will take you longer to figure out if it's fake than it will for it to make something else that's better."

Remember everything the general public knows about AI is delivered to us via the marketing department.  And who is more infamous for hype & ""disruption"" than the collective marketing departments of Silicon Valley?

Ad delivery algorithms always suggest shit I just bought.

Those examples are their money makers.  If the AI hype was real it would already be at work in those money makers and a closely guarded secret. Those money maker examples I gave are pretty incompetent.

The real danger of AI isn't that it will work, it's that people will say its working while trying to manipulate you.  The believers will believe so completely that people will get gaslit based on AI output.  And every business using AI will have an incentive around whatever the AI's output is supposed to be.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Ugh...

I'm so sick of hearing about AI as someone who studies and creates software. Especially pertaining to GPT. ChatGPT seems to be the new crypto, and it's being hyped way beyond its capabilities. It isn't magic, it's a large language model. In its current state, it might respond coherently, but asking to do complex tasks often results in junk work. Half the time you ask it for something, it isn't even correct. It's creating a bias from users towards useless untruths that the same users can't even verify because it's not within their realm of knowledge.

If you don't know how to code, ChatGPT isn't going to necessarily allow you to code. If you don't know chemistry, ChatGPT isn't going to allow you to do chemistry. It might be able to string together words logically, so if you want to write emails or write a movie script with it, sure, it could useful or interesting. It isn't what most people think it is, and everyone I know with any sort of knowledge and experience in software (that didn't come from a 12 week bootcamp) isn't as illusioned as everyone else seems to be."

Not to mention, just bc you crafted a video or whatever perfectly emulating a person’s voice and likeness, doesn’t mean the evidence will make sense in context. You would need to be extraordinarily careful, perfect even. If you happen to allege the falsified recording was made at a certain time that the defendant has an alibi for, that’s it, you’re fucked.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"I hear people comparing AI to the Industrial Revolution as a way to assuage fears and assure people that things will turn out for the best.  But that transition was long and difficult for workers.

For decades, workers were paid slave wages, subject to dangerous conditions and forced to work 80 hours per week.  Robber Barons held monopolies and controlled everything.

After 50 years or so of hard fighting, aided by the rise of unions, the workers began to gain some rights.  It took another 50 years, two World Wars, and a Great Depression until the Middle/Working Class really had solid footing and protections in America.

Things were pretty good for 35 years or so, until the wealthy started to convince enough people that they needed tax breaks, rolling back of regulations and anti-union laws.

Now we are back to Robber Barons running the show, while half the country is either actively simping for billionaires or too distracted by the bullshit culture war side show to pay attention.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"I think lots of people shit on artists because many artists have a gift that you can’t just learn. Yes, you can get very very good, but real artists are just born different. On top of that, we see a lot of art that sells for crazy amounts and it makes people jelly.

Enter AI art… Any idiot can be like “draw me a poodle that looks like a Viking”. (That idiot was me, btw. Cool result too.) Boom, ten images are right there in an instant. It makes the gift seem easy.

That’s not the gift though. The gift is being able to think of something that’s never been seen before and make it real. Real genuine creativity. Creating something from nothing. The gift isn’t some hodgepodge of shit that already exists.

Plus, artists, by virtue of their own innate creativity, are quite likely to be able to adapt better than most."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,I had a full on existential crisis about this recently. I’m a writer. The thing that’s helped me is remembering that this is going to have an effect on a lot of industries and there absolutely will be regulations at some point. There’s already legal precedent that art produced by AI can’t be copyrighted. So there’s some things to be hopeful about
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Wow, you are so in denial. What makes you think AI can't invoke emotion. The only reason they may not invoke emotions in you (which is wrong, as clearly, it does invoke quite some negative emotions in you), is because if you know it is AI generated beforehand, you just have biased yourself against AI art and just convinced yourself that it has no ""soul"" or whatever you think a human puts into their artwork. 

When you look at an artipiece made by a human, then you do not feel what the artist felt when they made it. Whatever you feel when you look at something are your own feelings, not those of the artist. The only thing that matters in the end to most people, is if an image appeals to you, not how it is made. 

If it is your passion, then nothing is going to stop you from making your own art. Ai isn't preventing you from doing so. If you enjoy the process of painting, what's going to stop you from doing so for fun.

Most people in the world never ever pay an artist to make some art for them. People with no talent, practice or time, but who have ideas, can finally make them become reality. Are you upset that your friends and family won't ask your for some free art from you anymore?  Those people never were your customers. Studios, advertisers and rich people will still hire artists. Ai will make your job easier. You also don't seem to be aware of how much artists cheat to quickly to their art for their job. Most of the work of an artist is tedious work, which is not fun at all. Having to draw frame after frame after frame can suck and can cause you to lose your passion. Wouldn't you prefer to work on the more interesting stuff. Ai will enable you do make your ideas come to reality quicker, it will allow you to do your own thing. A small group of passionate artists will have the means to make their own full feature film eventually, instead of having to work for a giant studio, where you only work on some small stuff."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Well shit, guess I’ll just stop making art since AI does it now.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Maybe in a capitalist sense. Which I don’t think wields human creativity well anyways.


Pretty sure I’d always prefer another human’s creations cuz we have real personal experiences that inform what we make.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Are you an artist? Do you write music, movies and tv shows? What creative work do you do? Most people in the world never engage in creative work. And even most artists will just do what others tell them to do and often just produce some generic stuff, because that's the stuff that appeals to most people. 

If you are an artist, then why would you stop writing your own things just because there is ai that can do it as well? The ai isn't stopping you to do your own things. Artists could finally have the free time and not the worries to appeal to the masses, and could just create whatever they like for themselves as a hobby in a world where they don't have spend their time doing work for others."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"No, because AI isn't creative, it can only recompile what has come before, and right now, it does it relatively poorly.  (Simply taking an average of all images it can steal, not building something new)  humans do process information and re use it, but we can use that input in new and innovative ways to create outputs.  Current AI, for example, could not invent something new.  It is incapable of inventing something, due to its inherent limitations.  It could do something similar in the future, but thay future is faaaar away."

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"The Industrial Revolution is the greatest story of innovation creating more work of all time.  And people fought that too: The original saboteurs and the luddites made a name for themselves by wrecking industrial machines that outproduced craftsmen.  Farmers who'd struggled to keep land in the family for generations resented the city merchants with their quick new fortunes.  Etc. 

But industrialization also provided more leisure time than having to farm every day, eventually, after years of reform and labor organization."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.," Optimization allows a shift in resources, a few hundred years ago most people were farmers, then the Industrial revolution happened, we have less farmers now (at least per capita not sure on the raw numbers since population also exploded) but the farmers we do have are way better, they can do a job with machinery that would take dozens of men to do before.

 So what do those people do? They have to find somewhere else to work, factories, or new business ventures.

 That said I'm not entirely sure this will be the same with AI, since all this work mostly took manual labor or massively helped. It depends on how far this tech will go, is chat GTP going to be able to create entire softwares on it's own? It's good at creating short code since there's a lot of content like that for it to take samples from but entire softwares that require multiple independent parts to interact with each other?

 What about midjourney will it ever learn to draw fingers? And maybe like programmers use something like co pilot to write code more quickly, artists will instead use midjourney to create more art quicker, they just need to think of the concept and fix whatever the AI fucks up. Maybe you will be able to create an entire comic that normally would take you week to draw in a few hours so you can focus your resources on research and thinking about the plot.

There's a reason why 99% of all hacking attacks are against businesses instead of residences. It's not worth the effort to hack into a home network. The same thing can go for robberies.

If a granny was walking down the street and Jeff bezos was walking down the street with a briefcase full of cash I guarantee you bezos would be the one getting robbed. The reason why is because the charge would be the same. It's armed robbery either way. Security guards are not much of a deterrent if you have a gun to the head of the person they're protecting. You would have to Rob 20 grandmas to get the same amount of money that's in Jeff's briefcase. That's 20 charges of armed robbery potentially versus one charge.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"The prospect of that is laughable. Lawyers will no doubt be using AI to draft memos and other documents (in fact, many of them already are) but they will still require editing in order to tailor it to the specific facts relating to the client. At least right now, AI cannot pump out a brief good enough to submit to a court, as is. But perhaps more importantly, AI can’t like… stand… and deliver an opening statement to a jury. It could draft an opening statement as a starting point, no doubt, but real human people give it life in a courtroom. 

I’ll go so far as to say that even if an AI were capable of reading its work aloud in its robot voice, an experienced human attorney would wipe the floor with it simply bc a jury can be appealed to easier by another person. There’s just an effect that good lawyers have on you when they’re telling a story, modulating their voice, pacing the room, gesturing, using props and demonstratives. Especially with the distrust and apprehension the public has for AI, a fully AI powered “lawyer” would immediately be at a disadvantage of credibility with a jury, at least today. Perceptions could change.

Maybe I could be proven wrong, but AI bots have a fuck ton of ground to cover before they can do a lawyer’s job. At best, I think they could provide basic legal counsel as a tool more efficient than a simple google search. But even then, most people looking for legal advice don’t know what to look for specifically, they just have a general question. The bot doesn’t know what jurisdictions to control for unless you tell it. So if you generate a good sounding, relevant response relying on case rulings from Montana and you live in Mississippi, guess what? That advice is probably useless. And that’s just one example. Effective use of the tool, assuming it even works adequately as legal counsel, requires some baseline knowledge of the legal system, I.e. a lawyer. So no, we’re not going anywhere. Not anytime soon."

I work as a project specialist for a development firm. We looked into buying 3D printing machines. When cost examined compared to human labor for walls we found them to be more expensive. It’s much cheaper in both the short, and long term for us to hire skilled framers, masons, or erectors compared to 3D printing. We’re not going to pay a million+ for a machine that we’ll have to make payments on for years, and hire/train skilled technicians to run. When a project is complete we don’t have to keep making payments to contractors, but with the 3D printing machine we’d have a permanent cost expenditure for years. While we won’t touch it ourselves, it’s entirely possible we could hire independent sub contractors to come in and print the walls. That would transfer the cost of the machine from us, to the sub contractor. They’d be on the hook for finding enough work to be able to make their payments. Even at that the cost for the walls isn’t seen to be any cheaper, and currently more expensive, though that might change, maybe. As it stands right now we’re sticking with human labor."

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"That's only true to a degree.  If we go through history there are plenty of jobs that  are in fact obsolete due to technology replacing it.  

&#x200B;

Using art as an example, films used to use matte paintings in films.  There was a whole industry of artists who did matte painting for a living.  James Cameron used to do it before he became a filmmaker.  Matte painting is basically obsolete thanks to digital effects.

&#x200B;

Films also used to use stop motion animation for creatures and monsters.  While there are still movies that use practical effects and stop motion isn't completely dead, it practically (not pun intended) dead.  Phil Tippett was *the guy* for stop motion and practical effects in films.  Famously, Spielberg was torn between using him or digital effects for Jurassic Park.  Ultimately, the stop motion animation just didn't look as good as CGI.  Phil Tippett still makes movies, but that whole industry is a fraction of what it used to be.  Artists who didn't want to, or were unable to make the leap to digital kinda just lost their jobs.

&#x200B;

And when the white collar goes, they're going to have to move to blue collar positions *eventually*, the blue collar is going to become over saturated, forcing the industries to put typical blue collar workers out to dry as well. Nobody is safe. This isn't 1950 any more, the population is too large for the workforce to experience such a frightening slash.

And by the way, the people that lose their jobs aren't going to be some random, infinitly smarter, and more resourceful than you person online that you're trying to troll. It will be your family members, your friends, their families. You're a horrible person. It's okay though, life has a funny way of coming back around. Good luck."

Alot of professional artists do graphic work for corporate clients to put food on the table.

No one ""consumes"" corporate art. It's just a business necessity that requires artists. With AI art, that need is now fulfilled by cutting out the artist."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,I want to know how people come to this conclusion about artists. Art is a selfish endeavor. But I don’t think all artists think they’re better than everyone else.

If an artist posts an image in a site that states in their policies that the company will hold rights on the content posted and/or states that they can use the content for their own purposes, the artist is indirectly giving their images for (maybe) be used in training or other purposes."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,">which really means it builds a huge database and copies bits of it when it needs to.

its fake, that's just not how it works

AI's don't have a database where they ""chop"" a bit when it needs, it literally learn how to draw something from reference images and creates its own images from zero.

They can't remember singular images, they are not actively connected with any database of images after they are trained."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Doesn't seem much different from the way humans function creatively, or learn language for that matter. We first learn by observing, and then regurgitating. It's not like we come up with our own letters and then our own words etc... ""There's no such thing as an original idea"" and all that. 

Though, I don't think you're definitely wrong. There is a (hypothetical but plausible) point at which it does just become copy pasting and that's an issue for sure."

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"There are still many graphical designers using AI as a resource. I personally have heard more actual people with this take (on this post and off reddit) and I haven’t seen the comment made by one person on this thread.  Again surgery robots still require professionals to use and maintain, and are still outnumbered in use significantly, not to mention you’d need a medical professional to tell a machine how to do so. A patterned job that’s often talked about is programming, which should in theory be easy to replicate, yet there isn’t any programmer who is worried about AI taking over the world, and they’re the ones making it. But if what only you say is true and these jobs do get replaced, there are still many people needed to maintain and improve current AI and robotics and I don’t think your one example of a graphic design job proves your point that in “50 years” every one of these job is getting replaced."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Yea but here's the issue. I realize it's a tool. A tool that can do great harm or great good. Or just great things in general.

Everyone here is a massive doomer. If you think every new invention is going to be the downfall of all humanity and nothing we can do, besides not doing it is the only answer.

So yeah it's incredibly frustrating listening to all these people being a bunch of doomers.

So I'll push back against the narrative. Ai is gonna be fucking dope. If ur not already using it for:


Cover letters.
Resignation letters.
Birthday cards.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"That's such a dishonest response.

What is happening is an iterative and agile process of automating construction that is, as I agreed to, ""far off"".  Currently a small portion is automated, in some cases, with the use of 3D printing.  It is started by people and finished by people.

Depending on the color of your hard hat (I think we can guess yours amirite?) You would have taken classes in the history construction and technology in college and you would understand how this works.  It may not be in our lifetimes but construction will change on a fundamental level as each part is automated.  Less and less of the process will be handed over to manual labor.  

The ""you book learnin' nerds ain't never worn no hardhat"" crowd will eventually catch up."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"I would absolutely welcome it as well. Having had many experiences with my elderly mom in and out of several hospitals in the last years of her life I have lost trust in nurses being able to adequately handle the workload they are given. She experienced nursing mistakes, verbal abuse, indifference, forgetting to feed her lunch once, and barely concealed hostility when asking for almost anything...help with controlling pain was the hardest to deal with and left us feeling so helpless. I felt I had to stay with her all day until visitor hours were over to make sure she was ok, and I did just that.

We also had nurses that were absolutely wonderful, and actually the nurses aides were the nicest, most helpful we encountered. I would have loved a robot that actually took care of her properly."

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"You should be less worried about the robots and more worried about all the white collar people leaving the city because of mass unemployment.

1. That's **your** interpretation of what people want from art. Thousands of companies and millions of individuals are perfectly willing to spend less than half the money on something from an AI.
2. I find it rather rare that a human actually accomplishes anything with art that AI can't. Sure, there will be details in the human art that are better, but don't kid yourself that humans are some magical artistic creatures incapable of being copied. For example, I write for a living; it's embarrassing to say this, but AI can already write basic copy way better and more quickly than I can. I have parts of my job that AI won't replace anytime soon, but **the thing I thought it could never do has already come to pass.**

Companies are going to maximise on profit even more on taxpayer money because the people spending that money don't care how much they spend and how much they twist the market. In fact government and politicians in particular are incentivised to spend as much money as possible so they slap on their billboards and campaigns about how much they spent for the people to get the people's votes because people are dumb I guess. 

Government is basically that super rich guy that buys up a bunch of shit skewing the rest of the market's prices upwards because their money is never gonna ""run out"". So they will take the priciest bullshit any company will ask of them. 

This will never change. Because no one cares about government spending, except for a tiny fraction who are typically fiscally libertarian."

Copying has always been around and it's always bad but not all images generated by an ai trained on a dataset of images constitute copying. The interesting part of ai is the ability to learn from data and then create something unique using what it has learned.

The problem with AI art is that artists are largely not agreeing to their art being used to train the AI. It's especially a problem for artists who have a unique style that's been essentially stolen from them because people trained an AI on their work. 

And, uh. It's not really selling that art? I mean, there are people selling AI art, to varying degrees of success. But there are plenty of decent free models to play with out there, so I don't think reselling is really the crux of the issue here, especially when potential buyers can just make their own. It's that, the fact that people can just make their own ""art"" for free with zero effort, even in the style of a popular artist that makes a living selling their art, that's really scary.

There's very little money in it and if you find that acceptable, that's your right - I just don't see how saying ""its fine, musicians will adjust"" helps anyone to solve that issue."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"I did not say TikTok doesn’t favor those genres, I’m not their audience and not a big fan of rock or jazz, so it would go unbothered. Therefore I cannot name a singer or band - but one Google search and it shows me that Master of Puppets from Metallica went viral in 2022 and was exposed to a new generation. If you want to know more about those genres, you should look it up yourself. 

I’m not upset. I don’t think that the little amount of money is justified or that anyone ‘just’ should adjust. But that’s a choice they can make themselves. And that’s not what I’ve been trying to say at all. I’m saying that it’s the new reality.  Holding on to the past and the way things were supposed to be because that will make adjusting even harder. 

I’m gonna call it a night now anyway, but good talk."

You do know that Metallica started in late 70s, don't you?

Do you really think they care about TikTok being their source of income?

\> But that’s a choice they can make themselves.

Sure - like you yourself can make a choice of becoming a famous musician, writer or a visual artist. Its that simple.

Good talking to you too. So lovely to correct you all the way. I can't get enough of it."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"That’s why I said “exposed to a new generation”. Because it went viral on TikTok it was on the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time ever and other charts. 

You can choose for yourself if it’s such big dream that you’re going to pursue it by spending as much time and effort as you possibly can. If you are not willing to give up that time and effort, you need to adjust (or die as a sad homeless person?)"
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Of course! Its the same with poverty - you don't need to be homeless or poor, you can wish your way out of it. Poverty is all in your mind. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps.

Thank you, Ben Carson.

RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"It’s ironic if you think you corrected me in any way honestly. You ASSUME I mean things in a certain way or that I don’t know things, while you cannot give a fair reasons for your claims instead of making assumptions with stupid (guilttripping?) 

I really don’t take anything from someone who is clinging so hard to the past, is ignorant for any chances because they’re bad and against your believes (cry cry) and thinks he is still the expert even though he cannot except the world is changing? 

And that gif proofs it even more. Crying about how little money the music industry made but not willing to adjust because you expect that other people will take care of you instead of doing it yourself. Don’t know if it’s the generation gap or/and the difference in continent, but I’m so glad I’m not stuck in your state of mind and actually am willing to work my ass off for things. 

In the meantime I would advise you actually read what somebody says, instead of assuming and focussing on ‘correcting’ me. I hope you can handle this though world that keeps changing and is completely against everything you believe in. 

Adios 👋🏼"

I believe in you."
RandomThoughts,Ai is going to ruin so many peoples lives so quickly its scary.,"Another assumption within a minute after I posted this. You don't know shit about me or my life and it shows. Good luck 'correcting' me on other responses I made. 

Maybe if you worked hard at that job, you would've gotten more money, wouldn't have to play the victim and didn't end up like a pathetic lonely man looking for his kinks on Reddit."
