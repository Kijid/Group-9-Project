graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?," Hello everyone , I'm 23 , I'm really scared of this AI thing .

I was thinking about switching from being an artist to coding because of it even though I really like graphic and motion design .

Do you guys think AI will replace graphic designers that makes branding and logos? or reduce the amount of jobs or cash in the industry?

I'm talking about the next 10-20years , since the development in AI is pretty fast

I really want to create a business as a graphic designer but I won't spend alot of years without being sure of myself.

in the other hand , I tend to believe it will help us the Graphic\\Motion designers with shortcut tools instead of taking our jobs .

What do you guys think?"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"AI will just be a tool wich will help amateurs do decent artwork, but to do real graphic design, you still need to do more than just autogenerate some art. 

AI is and will be very useful tool for a lot of designers.

And even if you have Hollywood level AI, i'm sure there will still be plenty of jobs for designs that need that human touch and creativity."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"There's been a lot of these threads, and honestly (and no offense intended to yourself) but it seems the main people that are worried are students, inexperienced and greener designers

The intro of AI will no doubt increase the amount of hobbiests that use it, pass the work off as their own and they'll earn decent pocket money in the beginning

AI will be a decent tool to help and aid designers, quickly create concepts and development, exploration, experimentation, it'll help automate a lot of the smaller jobs

It will kill out the more inexperienced designers that can't offer more than low-effort jobs, if you're even half a competent designer you'll be fine.

Being a designer isn't just about the tools and software etc, it's about ideas, concept creation, problem solving, creating a suitable solution to the problem at hand

So far, all I've seen are nice and cool illustrations and digital art - concept pieces. That people are taking and then forcing into a brief or making up a brief after they've generated

I've yet to actually see some how AI has actually been incorporated into professional work beyond initial concept and idea exploration. Let alone someone actually explain what they did, the process, how they came up with the prompts , why that prompt works for that brief and the client etc. It's all done after the fact

It'll get better and improve, but by the time it actually takes jobs from us, it'll already have destroyed a lot more industries - data entry for a start, coding and web development etc office jobs centered about spreadsheets and data analysis - they're all fucked long before we are

Which you say about switching to coding, AI will most likely ruin coding before it hits us (I would argue that coding would maybe be easier for AI to get into, see structural trends and, I mean it is coding - if you're talking about UI or how it looks on screen, that's design, but bare code... personally I think that'll be a lot easier for AI to get involved in) maybe at the same time. The point is, by the time it hits us properly, 10/20 years like you say, all those options are equally as fucked

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I'm old. Like, when I started University the Internet wasn't open for the general public old.

Do you know what was discussed on the pub with a beer in hand? If computers would replace our jobs now that they were becoming ubiquitous. It turns out that some jobs were digitalized, like instead of painstakingly paste Letraset to layout an ad and send it to the print shop you now just place digital fonts on digital paper and send them as PDF to them. IF you actually print stuff out and don't just publish it on social media or a website.

We youngsters understood that computers were tools but for the older designers, our instructors and teachers, this fear of being replaced by a computer felt very real and they were truly scared.

AI is a tool. It can be tinkered with and yield results, it can be used to remix existing content on ways that the human brain only does on drugs but it cannot actually create. 

You just need to open Photoshop to see that the content awareness tool is great but to really work you have to tinker with it until it does what you need it to do. I heavily use the feature on Canva that automatically resizes art to social media. I've never seen it generate a placement that I didn't have to manually adjust. 

I think that they are useful to make my work faster and maybe there will be truly amazing developments on those tools but at the end of the day they don't really ""learn"" from all the tinkering. I actually want to see a Photoshop that learns how my work process functions so I can create faster and better."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I think AI design will find a place in the industry similar to here services like squarespace and canvas sit in reference to professional web design services. An elevated tier of clipart maybe?

Companies/clients that in the past might have looked to a service or a marketing department for designs will be able to access an AI service, pay per query maybe, and have it generate logo and graphic options.

It's so early in the lifetime I have a hard time seeing this working better than a slot machine right now. I am sure it will get better and more functional as time goes on. Serious clients will probably be wary of the randomness of the product though. It's very much a curiosity right now."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,ask an ai to generate a logo for you and I think it will reassure you that graphic designers aren't going anywhere.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"AI is not going to be able to lay out a 90 page Indesign   Annual report with proper headings, infographics, callouts, navigation and relevant stock image anytime soon."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I feel like we get this everyday... It's not going to, designers will just learn how to use it on the design process."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Yea, I think graphic design jobs will eventually become scarcer. They won’t dry up entirely but I think competition for each job will be even stiffer.

Don’t let it freak you out, but I highly recommend start learning to code now. It will end up being a huge asset regardless of how the future plays out. If you end up sticking with design, knowing how to code will make life so much easier when it comes to web work. You’ll be able to create your own actions and custom scripts for design software like photoshop and after effects and will end up being a way more valuable designer.

If you end up becoming a developer, knowing design will put you at an advantage over 99% of other coders who only know computer science.

design + code = power"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"My agency has already started dabbling with AI tools for graphic design, some of which are INCREDIBLY POWERFUL. I see this empowering graphic designers rather than replacing them. You can much more easily conjure up conceptual images, but you still have to concept them in the first place and design them to turn them into usable art. 

To me, this is very much like the very first ""killer app"" in personal computing: VISICALC. It automated spreadsheet calculations previously done by accountants by hand. VISICALC didn't eliminate accountants, it simply freed them up to focus on more important, non-rote tasks. We might lose some production artist jobs, but conceptual high order graphic design will still need lots of humans. Let your skill be your shield."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I'm not worried.  I work in a copy shop so my graphic design skills are on the low end, but the time and attention required to laying something out for print is never going to be automated.  Every customer wants something different as their output and there just is no way they will be able to communicate that properly to AI.  So maybe the actual skills will shuffle a little bit, it's always going to required a human brain to get from point A to point B."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Nope, not worried."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I’m sure AI will replace certain parts of the job and speed up elements of others, but graphic design is pretty far reaching & there will always be things humans are needed for. Like it’s just an algorithm, but select and mask object in PS being so much more sophisticated nowadays speeds up my cutout process. It’s pretty decent and needs a lot less cleanup. So on a tight dl, I have the option to make more cutouts now with the help of that tool — though my design itself is not a cutout.

AI could figure out the elements of hierarchy by copying, for example, but it won’t actually know if the end product HAS good hierarchy or if it’s even readable or aesthetically pleasing at the end of the day. At my work a few years ago, they tried to replace a lot of designers following layoffs with auto mounting templates that editors could push content to & then designers could finish off, if needed… but even that ended up getting scratched bc content was so unique and editors already so overworked that it was easier and better for readers to just see something designed by a human. The people designing the templates also weren’t the people touching the product, so they never fit as a solution. You gotta think about how well the tech bros getting very excited about AI even know the markets and industries they’re trying to reinvent…. They’re like uber — not inventing something really, but trying to."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Stop it. No.

First, don't conflate art with design. Art is emotional, design is analytical. 

Second, the types of work AI could replace aren't important. An AI could probably design a decent business card because business cards follow rules and best practices and don't need to be original, but any logo it comes up with is going to be derivative based on the data is has, and the AI won't be able to reason its way into telling the story about why it's appropriate or what it communicates. AI isn't creative, it's reactionary. An AI isn't going to come up with [these](https://www.boredpanda.com/creative-business-card-designs/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic) business cards, it's going to create [these.](https://www.pinterest.com/BusinessCardTemplates/traditional-business-card-templates/)

Third, as far as traditional art goes, just because a new artists hits the scene that doesn't mean all other artists are obsolete. AI is just another no-name artist."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"As long as AI ultimately leads to a caste of robots s doing all the work for humans such that we don't need money, I don't care"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"You don't have to switch ""being an artist"" for anything, you can just teach yourself how to code. It's a handy skill"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,what makes you think you can just switch to coding? it's not easy i've tried it. Of course you may find it ok for you. What then when AI is taking care of coding too? i mean coding is logical so should be more easily handled by AI than branding which is potentially a lot more coomplex for an AI to handle.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Nah, the job of a graphic designer is at least 50% figuring out what the client wants. The client is usually unable to explain what they want. If they can't explain what they want to a human, they're not going to be able to explain it to a computer."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"There is a tech bubble that will burst happening at the moment, given you can upskill quite quickly in basic code and secure a high wage it's not always a bad idea to invest now and ride the wave. People thought the same thing when computers were invented it doesn't mean being a creative will become redundant it's just an additional tool. The types of jobs will change."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,I’ve being use dalle as a part of my work process and it does the opposite it’s very useful
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,I’d be a hell of a lot more concerned about AI if I was a coder…
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,yes be scared. it's coming
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I'm still waiting for floating cars and my hoverboard.

You know I'm still looking for a chair which is right for me instead of having to buy 20 to get the one which suits. I remember VR being the talk that it's going to take over gaming, it's crap. People are slow to adapt to new technology even though the tech comes out so fast.

AI is amazing! And the compositions I have seen are like just like paintings and photoshop digital paintings. Even that needs multi runs at the composition to get the amazing work out of the machine.

I think you will be fine, but you can always be looking at using new technology because maybe you might see an AI Designer on the cards and that's not Illustrator that's Artificial Intelligence Designer. Just keep embracing the new and you will be safe."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"This is like the boogieman for designers. I remember when my 70 y/o graphic design teacher told me that his seniors who did graphic design BY HAND were scared about photoshop and now look at him, he still has a job. Relax"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Nah we’re here to stay
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Half the people will fear what it will destroy. The other half will get excited for what they can create. IMO it’s a good thing to be an early adopter to a game changing technology. Ride the wave
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Will Paterson made a good video about this actually
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Maybe in 100 years when technology is more advanced maybe….? I doubt AI will ever replace graphic designers in our life time at least so don’t worry. It will probably only be a tool that we use in our careers.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I doubt it can read my boss’s mind. Sometimes he likes something but I know him and I know he means something else. When bots can learn to do that, I’ll start to worry 😬"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Why would they have an AI make a shitty design when they can get one from fiverr?
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,It seems AI is made to take all the fun jobs. Are there any plans for AI to replace managers and CEOs?
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"The day AI can translate ""Can you make it pop,"" is the day I will truly fear AI."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Test DallE or midjourney for yourself. I think they work great but it is not a direct way of creating. I think of one thing and the AI draws another. Both are great results but I will never get exactly what I wanted from an AI. Because I never get what I have in mind, the AI is a good way to get variation into my own work.

If this problem gets solved and the AI’s get better, there is a good chance that Grafik design will become unnecessary or a job where you give instructions to an AI. I don’t give it 10-20 years though, more like 1-5. The same thing can happen to all other creative and non creative Jobs."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Think of graphic design as communication. It's visual communication. If AI is going to replace visual communication, it's going to replace communication. I can't ever see that happening because we humans communicate with each other, it's what we do. Like why would a bird invent a machine that could chirp for it?"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,[CP Grey has a good video on this](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU).
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I don't think there is anything to worry about. If you are truly worried, I'd just make sure to continue learning and adding new skills to set yourself above the crowd. 

If you've mastered basic design tools like AI and Ps, move to Premiere and After Effects. Learn photography and video. A computer will never completely replace the creativity and mind of a real person. A computer can't differentiate between English language nuances like ""That Slaps."" It would think something is physically being slapped instead of understanding the slang.

The designer is in the person, not the tools or the software. 

&#x200B;

Things are always evolving. If cameras never moved to digital, I'd probably never be motivated to learn photography."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Use AI to generate assets to then use for animation or manipulation. They are tools, you are the artist. An AI will always fall short of clients changing everything specifically along the way to the final version. Only a human can get that done. Believe me, every client has stupid input."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,The client would have to **actually know** what they want to be able to use AI. That ain't happening.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"There's already endless amounts of stock logos, posts, websites, video templates, whatever you want, you don't need AI for any of that. I guess if your job is creating stock stuff then maybe some worry? I dunno, it really depends.

I'm personally not worried though, it's another tool, I already use and abuse so much stock shit due to lack of time that something that maybe expedites that somewhat could be great."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Ai is not always accurate so no I’m not worried.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,I wish AI would do my job already ugh
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"The same employers that outsource their design work will be the ones to try and implement AI. The employers that pay well for designers (of which there are a lot) will continue to do so. 

Smart designers will use it as a tool to help their work. People who avoid using it will just fall behind."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,AI could just as easily take over everyone else’s job. So don’t really care.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,I basically agree with most of the comments here although i think a few are underestimating AI and its usage. We are not that used to use it yet but that won't take forever. But i don't thing that graphic design has more to worry than other industies. That said i did GD for 4 years and now i changed to computerscience and i love it! Programming is a lot of fun and experience in GD helps alot. Just keep in mind if you are ever annoyed with GD give cs a chance
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"There are so many facets to the field of design and the vast majority if not 99% of it requires humans making decisions. I’m about as worried about AI as I am about Canva empowering coordinators to make web ads: unless you’re on you’re first entry level job the work isn’t comparable and thus there isn’t competition. As another redditor said, it’s a tool. Just as Pandora and Spotify’s discovery tools haven’t replaced DJs, learn to use the AI to your advantage."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I think it opens the door to more creativity! I play DnD on the side and having ai conceptualize a character for me before I can create the concept art myself is priceless. I think there still is value in traditional art of course but having ai as an option to create visuals in a snap is an awesome tool to have esp when creating a big campaign or needing additional character design concepts. I think just like any other design tool we use like photoshop or illustrator, I think this is just another tool we can use to help quicken processes and nurture creativity. I think it just boils down to how you use it as a tool and leverage it to add to your value as a designer! :)"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,You posted this exact topic before. You should be more concerned with growing your skillset beyond what can easily be replaced and less time fearmongering about technical innovation.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Once you've worked with clients, you will realize AI will never replace us, lol! 

Half of my job is mind-reading and helping people figure out what they are even trying to communicate. I don't see AI being able to distill human thought processes like that any time soon!"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,I’m less worried about AI at the moment threatening the graphic design industry & more about cheap labor overseas producing work for a fraction of the cost a designer should be making. I get solicitation emails on LinkedIn now offering graphic design services at $6/hour. It’s really frightening TBH!
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Well you can't prevent AGI from taking your job,  because it will be able to do any job better than a person. 

But the best thing you can do is get good fast, because these programs will be like a rising tide, making it harder and harder for new people to enter the field because all the opportunities to gain experience will be taken up by AI. 

If AGI hits, well have to rethink society in a general in an unpredictable way, so I don't think there's any way to plan for that."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Been working 10 years in industry and I've been playing with Ai for the past few weeks. It's impressive, but good for none specific results, typography is broken for example and it does not represent words well. 

At its current state it cannot form targeted, high level graphic design, more like random versions on what youre asking it. 

Ultimately I believe this will be used as a tool to make designers job faster. I can't decide for you, but learning to code instead/as well as is a good shout. 

5 years I believe it will become integrated in graphics and design. 10 years I see there being a knock on effect to the job market. 20 years who knows!"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"i'm mixed on it. 

on one hand, i don't think AI can replace human emotion, expression, the way artists can connect with a client on a more intimate level by understanding their feelings and ideas. i think of the AI generator as an input/output machine. might be useful for designers in the long run for something quick or composing artwork of their own. 

on the other hand, i'm terrified lol i'm starting college next year for graphic design, and i don't want to get an obsolete degree. and i'm always thinking about whether or not i'm worth the rate i ask for. i feel like AI is going to be popular with those who have lower budgets. some of the artwork i've seen these things spit out is incredible. why pay for a graphic designer when you can just use a machine to manifest your vision in seconds?"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I don't know how much it will disrupt the industry but I think it'll make things easier. For me, it's like you know how back then people use a lot of pencils and papers to draw stuff? Well, now you have Photoshop, Paint, etc. You don't have to grab a graphite and a papyrus or something like that, you just use your keyboard and mouse and draw on imaginary paper with imaginary brush."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Of course Ai will replace this job and many others... we cant change the future and progressions, this is like natural selection.... we die or we adapt... so we wont die OFC, so we have to adapt... when graph desing starts to ""die"" we will have a bunch of new oportunity in many other creative jobs... we have to accept and welcome the new AI improvements and we will have new oportunitys from this."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"In fact right now there are a lot of AI graphic softwares... a lot of you say ""graphic designer has to interpret what the client needs"" but.... these softwares offers a bunch of tricks and even the clients can put infinite ""keywords"" to match his needs... Of corse right now the technology is like a baby... I admit i was curious and even tried this and the results are amazing.... so... imagine in the next 5 years, or 10. 15. 20 .30 years.... or even more, with cuantic computers... we have to admit this war is lost... thats why we, the graph designers has to adapt for the future technologies and not to hate it... we cant change the future."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"AI will not replace creativity. Instead it will give you new tool to express yourself. 

Before AI you needed to practise painting before you could produce the work you came up and now you can create instantly. Like going from painter to art director. You still need creativity and understanding of art and design principles to command AI. If anything to use AI you need more information like art history and how program itself works.

To stop worrying I would suggest trying AI out (there are free options). Understanding  process should settle your fears."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"At the moment the legal uncertainties mean that major publishers and distributors won't want to use it in any significant way due to legal problems that could lead them to be liable themselves.

In the future, Disney will develop an A.I. based on their own exclusive catalog and then independent artists will have no chance to compete. Their work will also end up in Disney's data set and there's likely no stopping it from happening."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I hope so. AI is the biggest hype going, mostly hyped by news outlets. No AI can replace any human at this point, and they are decades away from being anything but mildly useful playthings.

Don’t worry about it."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Coding graphic designers are very valuable!
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Personally I think it will primarily impact illustrators and photographers. Where a lot of illustrators get their start doing smaller jobs for editorial or freelance. A lot of those opportunities will dry up as more affordable easier solutions come available. It will slowly get harder to break into the industry. There will be a need for higher level designers and Art Directors and people who can utilize the components and bring them together in a wholistic manner. 

I worry less about it taking jobs and more about ownership of style and copyright infringement. We spend our lives creating a style that can be stolen in an instant? That’s really sad and will impact how we think about graphic arts as a whole."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,AI is more like a tool for designers tbh
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Until AI can figure what a client really wants when they really don’t know themselves, I’m not worried. The biggest challenge is determining what the client needs. Client says “I want x”. Designer says that’s cool but take a look at “y” AND it’s better for your needs. Collaboration is a huge part of the process."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I started as a graphic designer in 1985. It was all paste-up and offset printing. Within 4 years, the company I was at bought its first IBM PC with Aldus Pagemaker for page layout. Over the next four or five years, everything changed, and by 1995, I had created my first website. But what really happened was that the term “desktop publishing” was coined, and business owners were buying their own computers with Adobe Pagemaker and expecting their secretaries to become graphic designers and save the company tons of money. Long story short, the secretaries hated doing the work, and companies realized the value of using professional graphic designers. Those that stuck with doing it themselves are not the ones you want to work with anyway.   
I see the same thing happening with AI. It’s going to replace some tasks and change others, but at the end of the day, you can’t replace human interaction. Graphic design has been changing every year in terms of technology and how you do your job, and it will continue to change. AI will just be part of it. I don’t think you should worry about losing your job. Learn how to use the technology as it comes along. As a friend of mine used to say, “Semper Gumby” or “Always be Flexible.”"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,Ai will just do all the shit work for us. It's still maaaany years away from coming close  to replacing a good designer.
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"If that doesn't happen, that means we failed the progress of technology. Fortunately, soon money will lose its value and then will be abolished. Look up Billy Meier's prophecies and predictions. We need human-level intelligent and creative machines to help us to make life equal for everyone and to learn and explore. So yes, there will be AIs that could convert our thoughts and imaginations to stuff we want, without using a mouse or keyboard or any other physical utensils. Jobs always will be around, not for money and payment, but for the fact that this is humans that have to evolve and machines are necessary tools to help with it, so for the sake of the evolution of the energy of Creation inside us, we have to remain in charge and have control over everything and use all the tools to learn about laws of Creation and nature."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,There is coding AI called copilot
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"It's hard to say exactly how much AI will take over and when, but most likely, both the creative and tech fields - along with most higher disciplines will be reduced or mostly taken over. Yes, AI can be a wonderful tool and time saver IF it stays in its box. But it won't, and knowing how clients work, they will mostly gravitate towards AI. This won't end well for most of us. We've never been at this place in technology, but rest assured, there is such a thing as too much innovation. It's what happens when tech impedes and replaces the human process vs assisting the human process.

When blue collar jobs were being exported and/or eviscerated by automation, they told everyone to code. A short time later, those coding jobs are now threatened by innovation run amock."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Late to the party.....

I believe 10000% there's no contest between a pro designer and an amateur messing about with powerful online tools and AI.

BUT - Herein lies the problems:

1. the amateur DOES NOT SEE OR VALUE THE DIFFERENCE. They truly believe whatever they created is as good or ""better' than our work only because they did it.
2. as slick amateur work becomes more prevalent, it becomes the trend and design standard. Companies looking to jump on trends and save money could assign ""design jobs"" to anyone on staff, or hire a newbie at minimal cost to churn out amateur looking work. Hell - the person doesn't even have to be a designer.

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I beg to differ. 

I am an experienced designer, and have seen this before. When the whole typesetting industry became obsolete within a couple of years in the early 90s. 

Sure, we can do high quality work. Just like the typesetters could do excellent typographic work. But these AI things can spit out thousands of options within seconds. It is an all-you-can-eat buffet for the customer. That’s just as significant that the fact that i can now do the work of 20 people in the 80s (typesetters, retouchers, manual graphic designers) all alone at home on my desk. And a lot faster than them. 

I expect these functionalities to be incorporated into design tools pretty soon. At first, we will be the ones using them. But soon the marketing departments will realize that they can do more and more stuff in house. Fast and without a designer. 
And the more integrated the tools will become, there will be little to no need for a designer at all. Niches, maybe. 

I expect to be basically obsolete within 5 to 10 years."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"As a designer, I might even use it for asset creation to then be manipulated and expanded on in a design program. It's great and I feel I'm trying to be as on board as possible.

We've seen simplifying tools come out and give no-experience regulars make a design for their party or local event they're putting on.

It's great, and everyone who has no budget is lucky to have these options. But you can always tell what app or site it was made with. Just like you said with AI, we will see it as an AI generated image because it needs the human touch and intention.

There will be some AI made in a Canva type layout where it will be heavily gridded when making your design. It will guess placement along a grid using this for aesthetic and accuracy, but it will inevitably come out stale and predictable. The work of a creative is still necessary, and the intention / impact of design is always evolving with new context."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I'd say illustrators&digital artists % should be much higher, as most small to medium clients would be satisfied with a quality Dalle 2 produces, depends of the project ofc, AI can create some nice abstract art, but can't do details like hands and eyes (atleast for now).

And I wonder why programmers are such high risk? We will always need people who code stuff like AI and various softwares, unless we talk about basic stuff like websites. But programmers always been in high demand, hard to believe it will change.

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Not sure if i can agree with you. Yes, when computers ""digitalized"" design/art field, it's still was pretty much an even exchange.

People still needed to spend years and years learning to work e.g. in Illustrator/Corel, InDesign, Photoshop with Wacom Tablet etc. etc. 

But all those midjourney/dall-e/stable diffusion ai art generation services are not like that. They are more like an endless supply of stock art. This is not like procedural nodes chemistry in Houdini or Blender, which also takes much learning and time to get goot with. No, ai art stuff is like stock photos. Just a finished product to choose, more or less. It's not ""stuff to make work faster"", it's basically ""stuff to replace the work"". Like, you know, illustrations that may took you days and weeks to do, which you could not even do without spending years at uni.

Which is why folks here question if many designers/illustrators (especially juniors who just graduated and already have trouble because of job market saturation) will be almost replaced, and most clients will either pick a result themselves, or hire an ""art director"" instead."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Exactly, and the more advanced/capable it becomes, the more it will evolve a skillset specific to that tech.

I think even that's a ways off. The example you mentioned is basically just low-end production work. 

Like say it means that instead of a 4-5 designer department you can do with 1-2 people, but that 1-2 people will just need to be more adept, although the tech improvements will also mean they can reasonably get more done in the same amount of time.

This is what we've already been seeing, it just means that actual designers need to be better trained, better capable. 

Anytime I've hired, 60-70% of design applicants I consider unhirable, in that even for entry-level junior jobs I would never hire them if I had any control over the process. A lot of design programs are inadequate, self-teaching isn't the path people make it out to be, and being properly developed and trained will just become more essential. People won't be able to fake it and get by like they have been doing. 

>It’s like self-checkouts at groceries. People thought they wouldn’t work for many reasons, but now no one bats an eyelid when they realise they can do it themselves or that these machines replaced workers.

In that case though the workers are zero skill, zero education. You can learn to be a cashier in 20 minutes. Sure, maybe remembering codes or getting faster takes time, but I've had enough where apparently neither are relevant to keeping a job. I also worked retail 7 years and being a great employee was essentially just showing up for shifts on time and actually doing what you were told. I mean that's promotion material half the time. 

So with design, the automation will just replace the equivalent, lower skill, lower trained designers. People that arguably shouldn't be in the industry to begin with."

Nope. It's autonomous. It can give you some eye candy to get ideas from but it's just software. Thus it cannot express anything for anyone. You can get the same from a search engine, museum or gallery or even the TV."

This ""ai generated art"" is not really comparable to that, thay are not an instrument like guitar or watercolours where you need to learn and practice for years to get good, they are just yet another ""rival"" just like stock photo/stock illustration markets. They more or less provide a finished work (which, though, you can take and manually edit/remix yourself. Just like you can take photography and draw with gel pencil over it).

The fear i hear in such threads, its that this trend will eliminate ""most"" of commercial illustration and/or graphic design, basically reducing the pool to ""senior art directors"" who will be just the people who ""filter and choose"" results from ai art machine, and who also ""managers at heart"" who have the best communication skills with clients. 

Which is basically sounds like a strong blow to 85% of people in profession, and death sentence for those who just starting - those people like me, him and them who always HAD TO go though early work years of ""flyers, banners, presswalls, facebook page decoration"" to get into profession, and some of them never managed to transform into ""legendary designers who do concepts for ferrari or vogue"" and instead still work at typography, doing pdf exports with specific cmyk requirements and what not.

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Illustrations yeah, digital art - so far that's what I've seen as well

And if it helps with the development of artwork to use within design, then surely (I think) that's fantastic and will really help improve time and efficiency - skillsets may swap, but that same person that manually create the artwork or the AI - it still needs the same directive. That human element to actually develop a concept, an idea, backstory, a brief, in order to generate said AI artwork in the first place

It's like Googling for an answer - when you dont even have a start point it's much harder, half of hte battle is getting the prompt correct and then going over it and correcting/amending/developing what you're looking for

If the AI can take care of the artwork generation, then fantastic, but it's still your mind and your skillset that's getting it to that place to begin with

I just feel with these posts is that people are putting too much stock into the manual generation and software and do themselves a disservice and undervalue their own creativity and what they bring to the tables outside the manual creation - the concept, problem solving, creativity, their mind yano - people have so much more to offer than what AI can automate"
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Pump out ""design concepts"" vs provide an entire brand, I'm sure humans will still win and be the dominant working force.

Add UX design into it, the only thing an AI can do is barf up previously generated content and explain statistically why it worked before. It can't personalize anything or be that personable.

If all else fails, I imagine we will have a story change from ""tooth paste cap twisters"" to ""tooth paste cap twister machine mechanics"" (2000s 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' reference) who teach and manage AI designers, similar to the front end coders, UX designers, or even Human Factors engineers.

Even when robots replace one thing, there always has to be someone to manage the robots. Our ability to answer the greater ""why"" trumps their technical capabilities, and will continue to do so for many years."

Typographers did a job that computers can do as well, so they went the way of the buggy whip. That's not true of graphic design, and likely won't be true any time soon, if ever. Computerized typography hurt manual type setters but it actually helped graphic designers. I see AI as a similar tool of empowerment. It may hurt production artists, but it should empower graphic design. Focus on the non-rote aspects of graphic design, the higher order functions only skilled humans can do, and you should do well for the foreseeable future, IMO.

It didn't, it just moved digital. The actual design skills were still there, it just removed the physical aspect of a printing press. And the advancement of tools meant that much more could be done within design, and a lot of time saved. There's a reason that from a technical perspective like 90% of everything from the 70s looks the same.

>That’s just as significant that the fact that i can now do the work of 20 people in the 80s (typesetters, retouchers, manual graphic designers) all alone at home on my desk. And a lot faster than them.

And we have a lot of new roles now too. So if those 20 people had come up through the industry in the modern era, some might have become actual designers, some into printing/prepress or production, some into web development or web design, some into UI/UX, etc. 

And sure, some may have never ended up in the industry at all, but nothing wrong with that either. Doesn't mean they couldn't still find worthwhile careers. It's not like people would be pushed out overnight, we've already seen tons of evolution over the last 25-30 years.

We already have that with Canva, and we're still here. 

Even with AI, to get to the point it can largely threaten graphic designers, it would essentially become a new skill set, new software that would require new skills to use. Even now, it's known that using the AI even just for composition artwork of varynig quality heavily relies on either luck of effective prompts.

Just imagine trying to use a hypothetical AI to develop a brand and product line, with all the marketing aspects involved, all the contexts of region, competition, target demographics, and then be able to automatically develop a complete design including all logos, text, regulatory info, and print-ready files.

I could be completely wrong, of course yeah - but I think people asking this question on this sub are looking at from a very design focused viewpoint - which your response to me saying this could be 'duh, look at what sub you're sub' - but I mean that AI is going to take over so many industries, design isn't an exception but equally this isn't just a design problem - it's coming whether you like it or not, so we need to assess it's capabilities and adapt, adapt the way we work, how we can involve it and integrate it with our processes etc

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Tbh I think coding and front end dev is more vulnerable than design. There's kind of a right and wrong answer with code. Design is at least a LITTLE more abstract. Tools like Figma already look at my layouts and spit out CSS. developers no longer need to define the style of a button for example. They can click what I made, see the the font is 1rem, margins 1rem, color is #1234ab, changes to #1236cd when hovered, etc etc etc. It's easier for me to build a website as a designer  with tools like Webflow than it is for my Developer buddy to design a website despite the fact that he is pretty much a wizard as a front end dev and can make anything I throw at him. I'm not as good at the JS and programming (at all) but really the fields with right and wrong answers requiring a little less creativity are going to be hit harder than people who need to think abstractly. We may well all be fucked, but ""computer"" used to be a job which involved people crunching numbers all day. There was a right and a wrong answer a team of computers working day and night were easily replaced by the processor chips that run the world today. It's the people thinking out of the box and solving problems which survived. AI is still crunching input and providing output, it's not thinking outside the box.

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"The AI in that case though isn't replacing the graphic design, it's replacing stock art or low cost gig work or stock. 

And the cases you mention with people self-publishing, that's may be technically ""professional"" as in real, but isn't professional-standard design work.

Mango may have overreached in the specific wording, but I think their point was that even if you could integrate AI into a work as an art asset, it's still splitting hairs, that's not the AI generating the entire cover including the development of the actual concept, layout, copy, etc."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"But your first two paragraphs contradict the third. 

If someone thinks they can use A.I. instead of hiring a designer, then they'd already be someone that is using Canva instead of hiring a designer, except in the case of A.I, as you said, it's only at a point that it can essentially be an asset in the vein of stock photos. Maybe you can use something, maybe you can, and sure it'll be cheaper than hiring an actual illustrator but if you can't get what you want, you'll still hire an illustrator. 

And in that respect something being a threat to illustrators or composition artists doesn't mean it's a threat to graphic designers because they're not the same fields. Like I mentioned above, if someone actually walks through what an actual graphic deisgner does, the whole process, the skills and experience involved, we have seen *nothing* even remotely close to that yet.

All we've seen is either not actually graphic design work, or just template generation but not really any better/different then something like Canva. 

>Which is why people now fear that illustrators or designers are in danger, as they fear that in the end, you'll only end up with ""art directors"" who just work as ""filters"" (aka choosing the best results from thousands of generated art).

I think it's ultimately a few reasons. 1) The people afraid aren't actual or professional designers, 2) They aren't very good. (And that goes beyond juts how something looks, but means good as in the understanding and ability, how to approach projects and develop effective solutions from scratch.)

If you're someone who is at an amateur level, and/or someone who might make decent-looking stuff but is largely just replicating work and chasing trends, then sure, Canva, A.I., then sure that's more directly competitive. 

But in that respect it's like being someone in low-end production who only knows software, with little or no real design ability, facing competition from outsourcing in India or China where they can do the same work for relative pennies. To avoid that you have to be better than that."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"It's easy to throw together something for a fan made movie poster.

Apply this to an actual brief, which basically no one is doing because they know it won't work very well and you will see how inept it actually is. For instance with movie posters, certain criteria needs to be meet, specific items need included. Good luck doing that all coherently through AI.

Illustration is not the same as design.

Either way. The more popular and accessible ""AI art"" becomes, the less people will want it. If anything it will drive up the value of human work. It's like saying canva replaces Graphic designers. In reality it just helps actual designers find legitimate clients."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"No shift, artists will just learn to leverage the tool. Procedural generation didn't kill level designers, neither will AI kill artists."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"They can continue to fight it out for scraps then, it won't really concern the rest of us, same as it has been with Fiverr, Canva, etc. AI will just continue to serve as additional tools for us, as it has been already. 

I mean if you go out and hire where the top 20-30% of an applicant pool are just in an entirely different league than the bottom 50% at least, and you see that those top 20-30% (even within a specific tier like junior/entry-level) aren't actually competing against the bottom 50-60%. They're competing amongst their bracket (top 20-30%) but not against the whole pool. 

I think that stems a lot of the views or even misconceptions based on the comments, a lot of people seem to think all designers are competing with all other designers, with a lower common denominator as some kind of connective tissue. That if someone can replace the need for designers in the bottom 30-50%, that is a threat to the top 30%, but that chasm is massive."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Well, that's not what I mean. I'm not saying to change careers. Visual Communication is an umbrella. You should never limit yourself. Always keep learning and moving up. It's like limiting yourself to Illustrator and never learning PhotoShop. The person that knows both is automatically going to be the better option."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I totally agree, there are clients who don't want to pay fair price for a design and then there are people who will design for bucks and just market disruptor, giving people idea that graphic design is and should be cheap...

Anyway i hate fiverr with my whole heart. Becuse it most time loses any correct progress a design should be briefed and made. 

Only thing worse then fivvers are design competitions for companies who don't want to pay fair price to one designer."

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"What you're calling ""their point"" was two lines in their original message, in contrast, they spent five lines on, as you say, ""overreaching"". What's more, their overreach indicates a lack of evidence for their claim.

>Being a designer isn't just about the tools and software etc, it's about ideas, concept creation, problem solving, creating a suitable solution to the problem at hand

If the designer toolset includes all these, then why are they lamenting they can't find anyone doing ""concept creation, problem solving, \[or\] creating a suitable solution"" with AI art?

If anything, *I* am the one providing evidence to back up their claim: Yes, AI art only replaces one part of a designer's skillset- Here are people who are in other creative disciplines other than illustration using it in their workflows."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"Ok, so you assume clients don't have imagination or what? Most of them already have basic idea how everything should look like. They will simply type ""girl holding umbrella under fullmoon""  and will be provided by hundreds of illustrations for their book or album cover, you can later use these visuals on canva, ""amazon kindle create"" etc. To get your own finished product without paying some designer 1000$. I just don't get this brief argument everybody is talking about.
And good visual is already like 50% of all design projects.

Increased supply never drive up human work, especially when most people can't tell the difference between AI and human made art.
Needless to say in the future AI will get even better.

And its not easy to ""throw together"" movie posters like these, most people on this sub couldn't do it or would take like a week to create something like this. AI takes 50 seconds, no artist can compete with that, and I feel like alot of people underestimate how powerful it is.

Big agencies will use it as a tool, but from now on good visuals will be much more available to general public and fiverr ""designers"" for a small price. It will definitely shake the whole industry and devaluate digital art in general. Also apps like canva will be even more popular among small projects once AI gets public."

graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I don't disagree with you, just its connected to many problems and situations. Like e.g. many job offerings just ask for one person who can do this, this, that and that while providing payment that could be just for one of such fields specialist. Sure, it's big and known debate, i guess. 

Or situations in life e.g. when after covid years you were left without a job due to reasons and you cant really afford yourself now to spend an year of learning new skillset as you just need to earn for living asap."

You're talking about illustration, not design.

Right... this says alot.

>Increased supply never drive up human work, especially when most people can't tell the difference between AI and human made art. 

They very clearly can. Besides, you missed the point anyway.

>but from now on good visuals will be much more available to general public and fiverr ""designers"" for a small price. It will definitely shake the whole industry and devaluate digital art in general. Also apps like canva will be even more popular among small projects once AI gets public.

No offence, but all of your takes here are laughably bad and it's clear you've never worked in the design industry.

The only person likely to get impacted negatively by AI or Canva is some amateur, inexperienced ""designer"" whose ceiling was making graphics for mom and pop shops."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"I left design years ago and now just do it as a hobby so no. 

AI won't replace professional designers for a long time. Even then it will likely never replace brand strategists and art directors which is the end goal for most designers anyway.

Most people here crying seem to be students or amateurs whose work is barely above canva level. The real ones aren't worried."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"It only seems pedantic if you think I stated it to disagree with them.

If you don't assume I'm trying to disagree with them, then it should be quite clear i'm literally just adding something to a discussion in an area where they said they don't know something.

Also, they are designers, they just aren't graphic designers."
graphic_design,Am I the only one scared from AI replacing his job?,"No they can't, there was a test where people had to guess which artwork was AI and human made, barely anyone noticed any difference, and AI been out for only 1 year.

Briefing is not a rocket science, every business owner knows what they target audience is and have marketing team who do communication, manage campaigns etc. AI can't do branding, but surely can provide good enough illustrations/graphics for ads to play with, saving clients tons of cash. 

You also just admited it yourself it will negatevily impact amateur designers. How is this not bad for the industry? Everybody used to be amateur at some point. Juniors will have even harder time now and design/illustrations as profession will be even more competetive and hardly profitable at the start."
