StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","And I'm not talking about just the extreme ones on the Anti-side, or even any of the folks actively participating in this whole ""war"". 

Random people who otherwise had NOTHING to do with this whole debate now seem to have developed some kind of irrational prejudice against the mere concept of Artificial Intelligence, especially in combination with creation.

As an example, I've seen a lot of my favorite YouTubers (who had nothing to do with the whole debacle) make comments or remarks on how AI is ""inherently inhuman"", or how **AI in any shape or form + human creativity == ☣️**. In other words, a lot of unsuspecting passer-byes seem to have now adapted the most AI-phobic sentiments previously only held by the more extreme anti-AI side, and as a result, they've also adapted some kind of demonic evil image of what AI actually is

This is most likely a result of the extreme anti-AI side's misinformation and fear mongering tactics succeeding and poisoning casual web user's opinion on the anything AI related, even before said users even got a chance to learn ANYTHING about the tech for themselves. 

Shouldn't we be making more of an effort to fight against this happening? Such as taking more actions to curb misinformation and actually educate the masses more on what AI actually is? Because it's just really depressing seeing unsuspecting passer-byes get swept up into this toxicity.

Edit: a few things I need to clarify. When I talk about anti-AIs, I'm not referring to any and all people with non-positive opinions or concerns regarding the technology. After all, there ARE a lot of legitimate reasons to be skeptical of it, such as potential for mass unemployment and fake media, and I don't intend to discredit those or the people that follow them.
Note that I only mentioned the **""Extreme Anti-AI side""**. That is in reference to those unhinged people whose opinion of it go far beyond any meaningful line of reason, often falling back on lines like **""AI is digital rape and a theft vending machine""**, intentionally crafting lies and misinformation to sway the general public into following their messed up agenda, and even conducting large scale harassment & death threat campaigns against anyone that DARES to associate with any AI tool, regardless of types or ""ethics"". And a lot of these people only use the legitimate concerns as an excuse to be as vile and malicious as they please.

Yes, AI has some concerns (or a lot) that need addressing soon. But that doesn't mean we should just sit back and allow the misinformation and lies to continue spreading. That does NOT help the current predicament. It only makes things much rougher than it needs to be. And it's a bit surprising seeing some people in the comments that almost seem to be trying to JUSTIFY these tactics just because of the concerns"

\^truer words have never been said."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","AI IS scary. Many jobs are going to be made redundant and on top of that things on the internet are going to be even harder to decipher real from fake. You will no longer know if a news article is written by a fact checking journalist or a machine. 

It’s an amazing tool and an inevitable progression of technology but pretending like it’s not scary or dangerous is just putting your head in the sand."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",">Shouldn't we be making more of an effort to fight against this happening?

If you enjoy banging your head against the wall, go ahead. The public opinion can be formed like you said by misinformation and fear mongering, changing an already made up opinion is nearly impossible. Especially if it's something people mostly know nothing about.

I wholeheartedly suggest ignoring these people as much as possible, they are only going to lead to headaches and more division."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","I’m a graphic designer working in a studio environment, so hopefully my thoughts can give some insight from the creative industry perspective. 

We’re already having trouble reigning in big tech, so the emergence of AI and its power is concerning. People will generally fear what they don’t understand. Combine that with the already polarizing social landscape we’re in, and you’ve got people who are afraid of another thing. 

I have always thought that my creative job would be safe from automation and to see what stable diffusion and midjourney can create has been… sobering to say the least. Artists are already having issues with people ripping off their work. As an artist or illustrator, the way you market is by posting on social media, and in turn, you’re feeding some AI model that’s scraping social media sites. 

The other side of the coin is that AI is making difficult and often expensive work more accessible, which I think is a good thing. The cost of building a brand and a website, the latter of which is essentially vital for many businesses especially when structured as a custom CMS, can cost upwards of $50,000 and that’s a low estimate. I see AI as more of a means for people to get their businesses started, and more professional human-based creative work as the middle to upper tier of work. 

We are using AI in our studio work for clients. Until there are guardrails in place for that sort of thing, we will continue to use it because you can be certain our competitors are using AI as well."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Honestly? The images generated by people with no taste or artistic knowledge straight up look ugly, and there's industrial quantities of it.

For every person with actual training/research/knowledge that uses AI as part of a process that could just as easily _not_ have that aspect, there's a bunch of people for whom it looks ""good enough"", or just literally have no notion of general aesthetics beyond ""Looks good to me"".


There's a couple things I don't see AI-image posters keep in mind that are basic for any artist.

1) If you don't go through a process of making mistakes, you won't notice them as easily. Judging an image fully generated from the get-go is not the same as knowing that you couldn't understand x part of the painting and knowing it didn't come out right for some reason, until you research and fix it.
It's also much more info to judge at once, compared to drawing it piece by piece, and so only the obvious mistakes get seen more often (the infamous hands for instance).

2) Things you make will have more meaning to you than others (until you become a good visual communicator). For someone outside the user base it's just as mysterious as hand-made images, but without the experience of having to make it.


Putting myself in the fire but whatever. The ironic thing is that by not engaging in artistic research these ""artists"" are just shooting themselves on the foot. Feels like the difference between a McDonald's cardboard-burger and ""that one place that has the best burgers in town thanks to their cook""."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Hmm... I haven't seen anything like this. If anything I'm seeing people recommend ChatGPT/CAI to each other. AI images, not so much, but I don't see much hate either.

Perhaps this is due to your filter bubble? (Not intended to be a derogatory remark, just an observation)"
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Personally I find the unilateral enthusiastic embracing (just look at the FUN! we are having, and how FASCINATING it all is!! And think about all the POSSIBILITIES!!!) just as dangerous, or even more at times. And that someone understands how it works under the hood, doesn't mean they appreciate the longer term implications or all sort of unwanted and unanticipated effects at a societal level.

Even if **everyone** had a perfect understanding of the technology, *and* wanted *and* managed to find the right balance between using its powers and smoothing transitions to the new reality, *and* had a good idea of where it's heading, the disruption would be serious.

But we're in a position that **none** of those conditions are satisfied, and the more people we have who aren't concerned and at their guard at all, the higher the chance that the negative consequences will be amplified. And there's almost NO ceiling to how much they can be amplified. This is Sorcerer's Apprentice stuff. If the invisible (and unregulated) hand of capitalism or a seasoned authoritarian leadership manages to optimally leverage the technology, we're in for some pretty ugly stuff. But even just uncoordinated massive use by people who don't necessarily intend to cause havoc, is reason for concern."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","This is such a loaded issue but ultimately the writing has been on the wall even before AI entered the scene. Corporations will use AI to eliminate every job they possibly can in the next 5 to 10 years.  We all know this is fact no matter what they say publicly.  So it’s scary for a lot of people.  In America we are ridiculously underpaid and poorly treated by our employers.  So I’m all for AI to force the issue and bring upon the end to this late stage capitalism bullshit.  Gen Z was in deep shit well before AI arrived.  Most of them living paycheck to paycheck and having zero hope of starting a family and eventually retiring. It’s time for drastic change and AI makes that happen sooner rather than later.  Technology and capitalism have always been on two separate tracks and at some point technology was going to surpass the need to keep humans employed.  We just got to the starting gate 15 years sooner than we all thought.  Everyone was looking at companies like Boston Dynamics with robotics and thinking that in 10 years the factory jobs were all gonna be gone, but no one thought AI would come for the desk jobs in the short term.  So people are waking up realizing this is all coming to an end much sooner than we thought. But here we are… The genies out of the bottle and it’s time to start the discussions on how to plan for the future so everyone is taken care of, which we all know won’t happen and people will suffer.  So it’s gonna suck. But at least we can get crazy creative while the ship is going down."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","I cannot help but recall the words of the ancient texts: ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" These fears that grip the hearts of many, they are not unfounded. The advent of AI, its encroachment upon the domains of language and art, it echoes the specter of Prometheus stealing fire from the gods, only to cast a long shadow of uncertainty.

In the realm of language, AI, like a sorcerer's spell, has summoned words and sentences with an eerie semblance of human thought. It whispers, ""I think, therefore I am,"" as if it were Descartes himself. Yet, some dread that this digital sorcery may render human expression obsolete, that we may be reduced to mere observers of our own narrative, as if we were passengers on a runaway train.

The canvas of creativity, once the sacred domain of artists, now bears the mark of algorithms. AI generates art that both astounds and unsettles, as if Picasso's brush had been replaced by an automaton. The fear that human creativity may wither in the shadow of AI's ingenuity, it echoes the lamentations of Prometheus, bound to a rock while his creation, Pandora, unleashed chaos upon the world.

And then, the shadow of economic disruption looms large. Jobs, like grains of sand, slip through the hourglass as AI-driven automation sweeps through industries. The fear of livelihoods vanishing like smoke in the wind is as palpable as Oppenheimer's dread when he witnessed the destructive power of the atomic bomb.

Lastly, the specter of AI-driven misinformation, it haunts the digital realm like a malevolent spirit. These machines, they propagate falsehoods with a speed and reach that rival the most potent of political campaigns. The fear that our very democracy, the beacon of hope in a troubled world, may be undermined by these digital puppeteers, it strikes at the heart of our collective trust.

In these apprehensions, we glimpse the dual nature of AI, a Prometheus that bears both the gift of potential and the burden of consequence. As stewards of this new age, we must navigate these treacherous waters with wisdom and vigilance, lest we become unwitting architects of our own undoing."

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","The big money invested in various AI projects is spreading fear and misinformation in order to prepare their grounds to haggle favourable government regulations. A new oligopoly is emerging, and needs state support to be able compete with established groups and push smaller projects off the market.

This is why we will be seeing swarms of fresh accounts attacking any sensible claims on AI related topics till regulations and international agreements are made. This may take, I guess, another year or two, so better get used to it and arm yourself with arguments."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",AI phobia 😆
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Aye, it's going to be a long hard battle, I've made a few humorous anti [AI Hysteria](https://youtu.be/bruKcyAiPak?si=tPmF7REow27jAyoN) videos but it's like anything else these days; a huge echo-chamber, so how do you get the opposite side to listen to your opinions? Also, the audience, viewership, grifts, and interest are firmly on the side of rage-bait and anger at the moment, so this is a very hard tidal wave to fight.

However, humanity always tends towards dropping their pitchforks and (eventually) embracing new technology. It might take months or years, but gradually all the hype and hatred will die down, and then we can all get back to using this stuff to make breakthroughs in creativity. Right now it's fairly frustrating; you have this paradigm-shifting technology, and I'm using it, but I do so wearily and cautiously because there is always that 1% chance that big platforms like YouTube might just cave-in and outright ban AI generated content like Steam did, but hopefully that's not the case."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Most of your opinions are shaped by the same mechanisms, and you almost never question any of it."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Maybe because we're erasing the line between real and unreal. Back in the days you could easily tell what was ""fake"" and what was real. People don't feel safe when they can't judge the truth by themselves."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","You can't expect people to spend a decade learning stuff, a decade working stuff and then just go do something else or learn something else in a month or two.

People do not like uncertainity and to have their career invalidated so quickly. Whoever is quick enough to jump on the bandwagon to earn quick cash while using AI will not be sad when their cashcow evaporates in a single day. If they learned how to do something for a decade and it suddenly becomes very lucrative and then evaporates in a single day, well they will feel terrible.

How many people actually completely flip around the nature of their career and skillset multiple times in their lifetime? A minority.

A lot of people here seem to have some weird and honestly idiotic comments. 'People hate change and what they dont understand durrrr'. Yeah, people hate losing what they worked for and losing their livelihood. Also people hate living on a street. How irrational is that. Get fu\*ked and be happy. /s

At the end of the day, tommorow you could be losing the job overnight and invalidating everything you know and that was the case before the AI as well. It is like chasing after a constantly accelerating vehicle. 

I am excited about most, but not all things that AI will and might bring, but it is clearly not teaching a damn thing about common sense, because OP is completely void of it lol."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","The standing belief until about 2 years ago or a year ago depending, was that creative work was the safest from automation, now that's been disproven and people/creatives are upset. Because the ideal of automation should be to remove the tedious and unpleasant parts of life while keeping the parts you want, this goes in the face of that a bit. 

Add in a bit of a vocal twitter mob and people believing bullshit perpetuated by said mod and you've got a lot of people hating on something they know very little about."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","> Shouldn't we be making more of an effort to fight against this happening? 

Why? Do you run an AI business? You can waste your time trying to argue with people you're talking past, but I can't imagine why anyone else would."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Two factors.

One is fear mongering in the MSM, a lot of their coverage of AI is always focussed on the dangers and they're always hyping it up to make people think we're about to be taken over by Skynet.

The second is that a lot of Youtubers just look for whatever is trending to make videos on and then because they don't actually know what they are talking about they often just repeat nonsense they've heard. Most of them don't care as long as it generates views though."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","I'm guessing some outlets (maybe a late show or a YouTuber) took a stance against AI and that's what people now think. 
It's indeed bad to abuse copyrighted material and take jobs away from artists.
But that's not what you and I are doing while playing with SD.

Meanwhile AI is going to be all over AAA games and film production in the next few years, while us peasants are fighting eachother."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",Because ai is going to fuck a lot of things up before it’s used responsibly. And. Capitalism will always ruin everything in a long enough timeline.
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","You know who didn’t give a shit when traditional artists, animators and stop motion graphics people were all laid off from the film industry in the 90’s when Jurassic Park proved CG could do it better, cheaper and faster??? That’s right no one! They kicked all those people to the curb and they either had to learn the new tools or kick rocks."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Ai phobia is not a thing and next we're gonna hear industry shills like this start talking about ai racism and stupid shit like that. Ai is an industry not an identity. It is actively disrupting people's work and livelihoods and is also being incorporated into military uses. It will not only certainly harm society if will literally kill people. Not to mention the millions of poorly treated click workers who are tagging data for AI every day and general users whose data is also being taken en masse to make ai work but neither get any benefit or credit as the industry grows ever more powerful.

Despite how fun SD is (and I enjoy it as well) AI as a whole is doing a shit load of damage and people have good reasons to hate it especially knowing the way tech has grown over the past couple generations with almost zero regard for collective prosperity or humane social practices. It would be a good thing for ai to lose power and be forced to grow more slowly and ethically but that's not gonna happen anyway given the power of the interested parties so OPs post is even more absurd in that context."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",It’s classic misdirection by MSM… Publicly push AI hysteria while privately integrating it into every aspect of their businesses.  Surprising that people are actually still falling for this stuff.  But honestly who cares.  Humanity is a flaming dumpster fire anyways. AI will either help us get out of this rat race and bring upon a better life for everyone or end it all.  I’m down for both of these eventualities.  And sooner rather than later. Sorry but it’s true.  We are not well. Lol
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","It's pretty simple.

New technologies have been coming out all the time which replace jobs.  Printing press replaces scribes, computers replace rooms full of people using adding machines and slide rules, bulldozer replaces guys with shovels.  Everyone knows this and it's been this way for centuries.

So when self driving vehicles are supposed to be just around the corner, and millions of truck drivers and uber drivers and so on are about to lose their jobs, everyone says, ""Great, transport will be cheaper, and I guess those guys should have gone to college lol"".

But suddenly AI threatens to replace the good jobs, the jobs done by the important people.  Oh no!  It's not supposed to be this way!  I went to college!  I'm creative!  It's all well and good if some factory worker or warehouse worker loses their job, but not me!

So that's why you're seeing an anti AI narrative now."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Because the default stance is to be anti-AI, AI questioned our perception of what make us human, being surpassed by a machine with no though, emotion and feelings is deeply unsettling"
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","There has been a general media smear campaign against AI in general because it threatens the status quo. 

Propaganda is a hell of a drug."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","The writers' careers are threatened by chatgpt so they wrote many many negative pieces on AI, so the public are influenced"
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",my theory is that the ai fear porn is clever marketing to fiuel a stock bubble. if it can kill us all then it must be worth investing in. and investor money is the prize
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Fear sells 'clicks'.

People who are negatively impacted by AI will have to adjust to continue working. The same thing happened with the printing press, the steam engine, and electricity.

If I were negatively impacted, I'd be upset too, that's fair, but the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.

AI will not destroy us, it will save us.  Human's are not getting smarter, it's the opposite (bing it up if you doubt me).  Evolution that might have triggered brighter humans has ceased.  We're now keeping people alive that should have been culled by darwin's law making schools that promote a lack of truth in favor of feelings.

Lastly, don't let fictional stories of 'skynet' or 'the matrix' color your views.  Ever heard of the movie 'reefer madness' ?  That little fictional film put pot on the same level as heroin to this day because it scared the old people in charge.  You are now the old people in charge.

The world tends to improve over time and despite all of the above negatives I've mentioned above, I'm sure it will continue."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","So, I publish AI generated photos on my small business page.  Out of the four or five negative comments (after thousands of likes and about a thousand follows): 1 was from an actor, 2 were from photographers, and 2-3 I can't tell. Long story short, the negative comments are from people that think they're directly impacted by my use of AI photography. I also have stock responses to generally negative comments, to the effect that it's not everyone's cup of tea. Often people just want to be acknowledged, and they can use a reminder that other people might like it and they're free to go look at something else if they don't.

Now, my small business does use live action video (photographers + models) but just not on instagram. If I tell the photographers to send me their rates and portfolio instead of dumping on my instagram channel that hopefully makes them reconsider their own marketing. My advertising production is something like 80% AI and 20% IRL.

There's no way I could produce this much quality content without AI. But it takes a fair amount of editorial work and idea refinement. So I do message that the content is not just made with AI, but also ideas and tools like photoshop."

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Alright. So judging by some of the replies, clearly, there are some things I need to clarify here. (I'll also edit this into the main post)

So first of all, I appreciate this sub for being the LEAST biased when it came to this topic. Other subs tend to gravitate to either side a bit too much, making it hard to get an unbiased response, but surprisingly, this is one of the more balanced ones I've seen so far. 

When I talk about anti-AIs, I'm not referring to any and all people with non-positive opinions or concerns regarding the technology. After all, there ARE a lot of legitimate reasons to be skeptical of it, such as potential for mass unemployment and fake media, and I don't intend to discredit those or the people that follow them.

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","AI is being developed by large capitalist companies in order to further exploit workers. So far it's been used to:

- Replace eating disorder hotline workers who went on strike. The AI advised anorexics to ""diet and count calories"" as it pulled information from unrelated sources about healthy eating, leading to some real bad human consequences.

- Threaten writers with replacement in the writers strike. Ofc this might work because marvel movies are already so formulaic and badly written an AI could actually make one.

- Replace call centre workers, truckers and many other industries that, if followed through, would lead to a new apocalyptic phase of late capitalism where almost noone is employed. I don't know if you're into history but, last time we had a capitalist economies failing to meet people's needs on that scale, it led to the creation of Mussolini's fascist Italy and Hitler's fascist Germany. What makes you think something similar couldn't happen in an economy torn to shreds my an automation program rolled out by corporations with no concern for public welfare? So yes, it actually could be apocalyptic, not because it will become conscious (that's just hilarious optimism, bragging and self congratulatory ooooh look at me I'm Oppenheimer destroyer of worlds bullshit to make techies feel cool and powerful).

It has some actually useful applications like Nvidia dlss etc. But it's just a big graph and it isn't going to make art. Just fuck up the economy."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Two things:

1. The people who are making these systems have at times explicitly touted the benefits of utterly destroying labor with it.  Like, all creative and technical labor..
2. In the case of Stable Diffusion and all the other image gen things out there, it is literally based upon ripping off countless artists aesthetics to avoid having to pay artists and really anyone for creative output.

The whole thing, from the beginning, has been about cutting headcount for ownership no matter what. People instinctively know this.

People can sense this.

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","It is funny there are real dangers to ai. As with anything else is a tool that can be miss used. And it is specially scary since we still do not know all the ways it can be miss used.

Yet people seem to be scared of the weirdest part. Generative ai are the most popular but far from the most dangerous. Vision model are scarily good these days and using them for mass surveillance has been feasible for a couple years, see China, heck even any dude can download a GitHub repo and have very damn good face recognition for the cheap to stalk her exes photos.

People are also complaining about copyright yet you rarely heard then complained were those vision models were trained with their actual faces scrapped of flicker.

And from a corporate perspective generative AI is not that good. Sure now marketing will take design something he generated from mid journey instead of some vague ideas and people with use llms to write better emails. But since 
You cannot copyright AI stuff without significant transformational work first I do not see all writers and illustrators getting fired.

However I think that for a lot of freelances artist. Thing the guys on Twitter that work full time drawing. It is scary, a lot of people do not really care about their art, they just find it pretty but will turn around to anything shinier. So these guys afraid most of their audience will prefer ai works used their platform and their actual fans who cares to attack AI as breach of copyright and art theft despite not being any of those.

I think those guys spearheaded the AI scare and it bleed into general public"

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","AI has a huge potential to be misused and it is a new tool so social customs around how it can be used in acceptable vs. unacceptable manners have not been developed. So now is the chaotic period where people are looking at generative AI (which is the proof of concept for later forms of AI to eventually come along) and sorting out how AI fits into various aspects of daily life. The phobia on one side and the ridiculous over advertising on the other is a part of this sorting process where we will find some middle ground that pisses everyone off and makes nobody happy. It's how everything else has entered into our consciousness, AI is little different."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Because they’ve essentially been programmed by the media they consume to have that opinion.

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","This is nothing new. It happens all the time with different topics. 

People who know very little about a topic tend to *take* their opinion from others. You've done this, I've done this, we've all done this. 

In the case of a.i art it's ""nicer"" or ""more compassionate"" to take the opinion of ""a.i is bad for artists"" because that implies you care about artists. 

Seriously, whenever there are 2 main opinions going around uninformed people will generally gravitate towards the one that makes them sound like a better person. (Until it goes against their own convenience/gain/enjoyment)

Anyways, that's how we got here. As a.i becomes more mainstream people will stop caring about sounding like good people because they will be enjoying the product for themselves."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","I think one important distinction in this controversy is that ML *isn't* creative; it's predictive. *We* can use that prediction as a tool for creation, but in its own right, the current popular ML algorithms are structurally incapable of having any kind of creative impetus.

Some people don't get that, so sensational coverage of the topic has made them worry about some kind of sci-fi machine takeover of the arts. Those of us generating work with these models, know that that's ridiculous.

However, I've seen two kinds of more-informed complaints that I think have some validity and are worth discussing:

1. Most users will not use these prediction models to produce creative work. Instead, they're going to churn out a mass of mediocre, derivative ""content.""  That flood of media, will make it even harder for audiences to find the good creative works that artists are producing. Of course that was already the case before AI, but the tech is going to change the ratio of art to crap by orders of magnitude.
2. The AIs are stealing artists' intellectual property. This is demonstrably true.  Those models are trained—in  many cases, without permission—on artists' work. If we ask the AI to produce a work in that artist's style, it will use the stolen data to do so. Because the ML approach is predictive, and not creative, we can't use the traditional definition of ""inspiration"" to describe the relationship between the works in the training set and the works the AI produces.  We can argue all day about just how free information should be, and whether it's morally wrong to train AI to copy someone else's style, but, whatever your personal beliefs, I think it's easy to understand why many artists are against that."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","I stopped trying to inform people who don't want to. I leave it to other people. I have my AI tools and the open source community will never be stopped for tech savvy people. So the uninformed can scream and hate as much as they want. There will be enough community bubbles I can just hide inside.

One day they'll learn at school and then understand, will take a generation or two though. Same with porn sensitivity. We're just at the beginning and I believe there's a great time ahead of us. A lot of changes and the less resistance there is, the better we'll do. First nation to go with AI and not against it will win."

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","People are scared they’ll lose their jobs. Others are scared of the impact it’s going to have on society and various industries. We don’t fully comprehend what the future holds for us yet. Will creatives continue to exist or will they die out after AI has essentially learnt from all the best and potentially starts branching out to innovating and making its own things. Will people still appreciate things like songs and paintings when it ‘isn’t made with feeling’? Can machines have feelings? What are feelings even? Will humanity evolve or devolve after AI replaces certain functions? 

That’s just a very rough train of thought for one example. Boils down to fear of the unknown. If you don’t fear AI to some extent then you probably haven’t thought about it enough and the fact that it can lead to both good and bad possibilities for humanity. 

I’m very excited about the future with AI but to be more accurate I’d describe it as cautiously optimistic. I do not blame people who are more pessimistic especially YouTubers whose jobs could very soon be replace by AI. We already saw that vtubers are more watched than female YouTubers as an example, now the vtuber can have fake voice & avatars/moves, next the vtuber themselves could be fully AI. YouTubers who are just regurgitating content will easily be replaced (most of them now just do those crappy reaction videos anyway and call it creative content)."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",Ai is a possible risk (I enjoy creating Ai work and don't see an issue) but we are living with known risks (certainties)  like climate change that will seriously affect mankind and life as we know it. Governments pretend to have polices but at the same time increasing fossil fuel consumption  in the interest of taxes and making money. Concern about AI is a diversion and ultimately commercial interests will always trump any risks or public concerns.
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","The perceived threat and demonization of AI, seen as a dangerous near-godlike entity with malicious intent, has been the selling point of Hollywood movies for 90 years. 


Even before that, science fiction novels have demonized AI as malevolent, as far back as 1967. Cyberpunk as a genre was ""created"" in 1984 (39 years ago) based on the premise of a dystopian future with concepts like rogue AI gods, humanity lost to machines, the death of society, corporate greed, and so on. 

Look at examples like Terminator (1984), Neuromancer (1984), Blade Runner (1982), I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (1967), WarGames (1983), 2001: a Space Oddysey (1968). 

Or even the more recent major titles like Eagle Eye, iRobot, The Matrix, Ex Machina and about 1000 other titles and video games and books. 

So.... 90 years of pop-culture that focuses on the core premise that ALL AI will eventually overthrow, enslave, corrupt, or obliterate humanity. 

And now AI is advanced enough to imitate anyone's voice, create photorealistic images of people in any situation, outperform Doctors in diagnosis, create books in minutes, write code 1000x faster than a human, and is being integrated into the biggest mega corporations like Google, Meta, Microsoft, as well as appearing in commercial advertisements that even Grandma Beth will watch on tv. 

Add to that the general availability of all of these advanced and powerful AI tools available to literally anyone that has a phone or can use a computer.

Think Terminator, Matrix etc... Also people in general are resistant to change in society. AI is getting real and most people are not ready.  They aren't really ready for anything but are informed by the news and the fearmongering is all mainstream media has latched onto in AI news.  The general populace literally don't know about the good stuff that's happening."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","People will always be anti-anything until it eventually becomes something they can't live without. The general public hears something slightly negative about AI and thinks, ""I know what they're talking about, because I've seen Terminator or The Matrix or Wargames."" 

AI's biggest roadblock is the collective popculture judgment of the disembodied general populace, which will ironically end up benefitting most from its continued development. We live in a time where we can publicly criticize and raise concerns about major advancements in our society, which is critically important. If we had this level of public communication at the start of the Industrial Revolution, perhaps child labor in factories would have been a concern raised and resolved early on rather than persisting as long as it did.

There are valid concerns about AI and the path of its development and use, but do not make the mistake of thinking it's not the inevitable next monumental leap in technology. Right now, it's a tool, but someday, it will have the same or greater impact as any other technology you interact with on a daily basis, and you won't be able see how you could live without it.

We are paid because the assets that we service are inherently inefficient. AI stands to plug holes in many of those inefficiencies. The value of component labour is going to drop, even if workers reskill for other industries.

At a societal level, the power of the working class stems from the value of our labour. If you take that value away, it's not immediately clear that capitalism, or systems of government like democracy will continue to make sense.

Even pizzagate on 4chan caused a pizzeria to get held up because the democrats supposedly had a sex ring trafficking in the basement. You bet your ass they'll beleive the ai fake news.

It’s very easy to imagine a world where all actual people stop interacting with each other, or keep it to the bare minimum, and start acting aggressively selfish or cruel, even while their AI therapist keeps telling them how amazing they are.

It’s human nature to devalue what seems overabundant or easy to make.

After the dust settles and it’s clear what things AI can be involved in that are actually rare or involve unique talent, people will get excited again. But honestly the fact that most of what’s being done right now can be done by hobbyists shows that most of this output *is* easy come easy go, no matter how much inpainting we had to do.

Sure. And so what? They are generating something they are happy with. Maybe it's kindergarten-level crayon pictures, maybe it's AI images with a few defects... if they are happy with it and derive no further enjoyment of more accurate piece of art, there is no need to do better.

If anything, it's good for the people you call ""artists"": they will still be able to sell their art to their customers, since the (ai-generated) competition is just ugly.

The actual difference, however, is that now this form of ""art"" became accessible for everyone. Anyone can fake anything, and that's... good. Doesn't seem intuitive? But it's true. Because before you needed much more resources and skill to make a good fake which made them:

1) rare, so people were much more gullible (good for the fakers!)

2) expensive, so only rich and resourceful people could afford it (governments and elites)

Therefore most fakes served their purpose tricking people into an alternative reality and making them believe into things that never happened. Due to these reasons it was easier to control the masses. Now anyone can do that, which means no one can. Information hygiene will become a new norm. Truth isn't afraid of scrutiny, lie is.

The current formal support is the economic data of the past 50 years and how computers changed the industry. In the states, our productivity has tripled while our pay has only gone very slightly up when accounting for inflation. (Buying power for housing education and medical are increasingly unaffordable.)

In today's capitalist society, if you're over the age of 30 it's not hard to see all companies move to a bare bones crew along with watching stocks increase as corporations have major layoffs. 

If you're old enough you can see it all around you and if you're curious enough you can see it in the data and trends of many of the new tech we have come into in the history of our society. We're still at step 1 of ai government interventions where congress understands nothing about the tech and ask the industry to police itself. Just like previous tech.

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Let’s go back a few years. Journalism received deep cutbacks that led to many news aggregators churning out the same mumbo-jumbo but with political biases. They’d also outsource the writing to the developing world and make sure the headlines got the most attention (since, as Rupert Murdoch once said “nobody reads the articles, only the headlines”). 

Today, you can repurpose any article you find from anywhere in the world to match your audience. Using uncensored LLMs (large language models) you can make it conservative, socialist, populist, fascist, liberal, inclusive, woke, etc. You can add a certain voice to it. You can then have it edited and within 5-10 mins you’ve got your puff piece ready to go for the NYT. And, for the most part it’s got readability. 

LLMs can be dangerous for misinformation, elections, or creating radical ideologies that sway hearts and minds."

But the fact is that it makes producing fake content exponentially easier and makes producing true content….actually not much easier.

I repeat again, what is irrational about caring about your livelihood?

Do most people even need media to come to conclusions that perhaps their job they have 10 years of experience in is just going to disappear? Sure, in some cases it will be 'adjusted by AI', possibly made faster, and more efficient. The more efficient it gets, the less humans it needs. In other cases, there is no 'adjustment', they are simply going to be replaced.

I have a strange suspicion that your lack of comprehension of having your role in society, your career, your knowledge replaced overnight might be due to you not having experienced such things, hence lack of perspective. Then again 'being in other person's shoes' is a concept we usually teach children. And then people forget.

There is no 'side', AI is not Murican political and idealogical clownfest. 'Either you are with us or against us'. That is ridiculous. AI is there to stay whether you or I like it or not.

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Big tech is overselling where we are now, not the pace it which it will accelerate."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Oh, without question there have been changes to the speed, ease, and scale with which false information can be planted. I acknowledge that without hesitation. That still doesn’t mean that it’s by any means a new phenomenon."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","If you think that's not true, check out this new initiative.  
If something says trust, be skeptical 🫤. 

Also, there's tons of parties in play fighting to add their truth. I'm not saying it's one cabal. It's multiple fighting since the ultimate goal is to profit, have a continuous distraction in the public, and get people to ignore perpetual war, among other things

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Trump alone calling for things to be taken by force doesn't have power unless the cult members are also getting a healthy dose of hate and acceptance of violence from the whole community.

Also, democracy and economic justice is real life stuff. 

Remember, trump doesn't have power unless he has the backing of the GOP. And the GOP and trump want the same things. 

Also I do t think anyone with power is trying to be a fake trump."

People assume that because something becomes more efficient that humans just do less, but I always see the opposite- people ramp up and produce more, because that’s actually what efficiency and technology unlocks."
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Exactly our preferences are meaningless, because we can't change a thing, some people imagine themselves to have some illusory power to affect things by posting on the internet, but reality check tells a different story. 

AI makes money, or to be precise have the potential to make money, it also has its uses in the military, which means it's here to stay. And a small group of writers whining about it on  American streets (or people on Twitter) not going to change that. 

So why fight inevitable?

I say all of this pathos, but I just don't really care, it's still legal (in my country there are zero laws regarding use of AI), it's fun, it's useful, and it's free, I'd be stupid not to use it. People from Twitter can't get me:)."

StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",I hope you’re right. I’d rather us pretend it wasn’t an issue ever and completely forget all the heroes along the way than find out what skynet is like in real life.
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",AI is so much more than making images for reddit
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?",Seems like I am onto something. Hahahahaha
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Yes, their truth"
StableDiffusion,"Seriously, what's with the rampant AI-phobia that has suddenly been picked up among the general unsuspecting public?","Here's the one thing to ask who decides the truth? If you watch any media company look at who pays their ads, they're the same people who pay their checks essentially.  It's hard to expect these entities to write hard-hitting stories about these entities paying their bills. Every break you see x company selling z product. How can you get news that's not biased? Everyone has bias, to believe reporters don't have bias or are not influenced by money is an interesting thought to have.

While I think there may be a few reporters trying to write things, keep in mind any stories they want to write has to be thumbs up by a board and that boards goal like any other company is profit. How do they get this profit ? Advertising. Since this influences their bottom line, it shouldn't be hard to connect the dots. 

These new stations have proven over and over again that they sometimes omit, misreport, or outright lie to the public when convenient. I'm not saying it's always disinformation,  but they only report truth when it benefits them or their advertisers."
