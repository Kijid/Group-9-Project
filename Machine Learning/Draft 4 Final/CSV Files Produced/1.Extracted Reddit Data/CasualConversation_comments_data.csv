EDIT 2: I just woke up... sorry, I don't have time to reply to you all :(

I love technology and I love AI. A computer simulating a neural network to do complex tasks is freaking science fiction - but it's *real*. It's magic. Take a second to realise that two hundred years ago the first electric motor was invented... and now we have chips with billions of transistors that are each like 70 silicon atoms wide doing *billions* of calculations per second in order to simulate the acts of writing and making art and coming up with creative ideas! 

So why am I scared? I should be excited. Is this just something that everyone experiences as they get older? 

Have I already gotten comfortable with the way the world works, and is that why this change is uncomfortable? But I've grown up with change being normal. There isn't a day that something new isn't invented or discovered or revolutionised. I should be used to change. Actually, I thought I'd be more uncomfortable if everything stopped changing at an ever increasing rate.

I'm only 18. I shouldn't be saying things like ""Back when I was younger"" to kids already. But that in itself is exciting, in a way. We've come so far as a species. It's amazing"

My thoughts on change.","Old guy here. I'm scared too. When it comes to art and human expression, we're at a low point, and I fear that AI may pretty much be the final nail in the coffin. I don't think many people will dedicate decades of their life to learn a craft, just to be able to create art which any kid with a AI subscribtion can create faster and better.

Sometimes, society just becomes worse, at least in some aspects. It's sorta taboo to mention it, but there is no natural law stating that any change in society should be for the better."

You'll still be paying most of your paycheck in rent and working a miserable job, except now AI can be used to simulate entire conversations on the internet to fake support for questionable policies and create surveillance states past dictatorships could only dream of. I wouldn't be surprised if they'll start using machine learning to rank DNA for things like intelligence and fitness and give eugenics a facelift."

I’ve butchered the quote but you get the idea.

I’d also mention that it seems to me that a lot of older people who embraced technology have ended up quite successful."

It compliments the lack of knowledge I have for some tasks and allows me to help further my company in achieving it's goals. 

I've tried asking for code and it either breaks all the time or it takes too long to generate text. There are even some ""hacks"" to make it tell me what I need without getting errors but it still lacks the capability to deliver everything we need.

I thought I'd be dead at 18, I'm still here, I've passed that age, but I don't know if I'll be alive 10 years, 5 years, or even 1 year from now.

We're already in a stage of capitalism where most of people own really nothing and if you're not born without assets you're essentially pretty much guaranteed to never be able to get an. Like playing monopoly but only every collecting 200 bucks when passing go and giving that to the already rich on their walk around the board.

Now think how many of those folks are loosing the only occupation they are able to do to get their small amount of monopoly money.

Calling a doctor to get a prescription, make an appointment?

Needing a Service information?

Need help with any service you have subscribed to?

Everything that is simple desk work now - that is going away an probably quickly.

Also those ""as a software developer I am not scared"". I am a software developer and if I do extrapolate from the development in the last 3 years - man if you don't want to retire in the next 3-4 years you should be.

As soon as llms get to the point of comfortably handling some 100k of context it will be game over for A LOT of software developer work too. Of course not everyone but A LOT of currently employed persons will essentially become nonessential.

And trust me llms will get there. I mean look at where shit got with only a small select speartip  of folks working on the models. What do you think will happen now that a much wider audience of devs will be able to develop plug ins for gpt-4. 100% some shifty bastards will be able to introduce some sort of working memory management plug in that by stringing several different gpt models or just gpt-4 instances boost the context size or something like this.

If you're not scared you are just not grasping whats happening."

It started off funny, for sure, but i can't be the only one that can imagine how maliciously these can be used, right? Especially as it gets refined in a (technological) generation or two. 

But ya know, the fuck can i do?"
CasualConversation,"My parents have always said new technology scares them. I didn't understand since new things always seemed exciting to me. But GTP-4 has, for the first time, made me scared. My thoughts on change.","I may be getting older, but I'm not afraid of it.  Here's why:

AI has been being researched and would be 'the next big thing' that would take over the world within a decade since ... the 1950s, with the earliest symbolic AI and neural networks.  Then in the 1960s, AI was 'the next big thing' that would take over the world within the next decade.  And in the 1970s.  And the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s.  So my parents were born and grew up hearing that and then so did I and then my kids did, and now my grandkids are hearing about it.  It took a few whole lifetimes for it to get to this point.

And now we're *finally* getting some really useful stuff out of all those decades of slow gradual AI development!  That is exciting and wonderful.

As recent as the mid 2000s, OCR was crap.  It only worked with very specific fonts and layouts with no images or decorations on the page.  Even then, when you scanned a page and OCR'd it, it took so much time and effort to correct it that you could have literally just typed the thing in yourself faster and easier.

Nowadays you can just point your phone at some fancy text in an odd font on an illustrated menu or sign and it will immediately not only OCR it but also translate it for you right there in real time!  That's very helpful.

The latest hype is generative AI including LLMs like GPT and AI generated images like Midjourney and DALL-E.  Currently a lot of people are trying to do all kinds of things with it and finding that it doesn't really do very well at most of them.  Kinda like the old OCR, it's not really great except in very specific cases.

But think of the future!  It will become a tool that will allow us to do so much more, more easily, and things we couldn't do otherwise.  As I'm getting older, I don't have as much time to spend many years learning new things and practicing new skills.  Having an AI that could create useful stuff for me would be awesome.  I'd be able to get so much more done and do things I can't now.

Right now, it's really good as a brainstorming and inspiration tool.  You can bounce ideas off it about anything, and it can give you several ideas to draw from.  You can take those and put your spin on 'em and actually create something instead of being stuck with writer's block or just doing random 'research' and sketches and hoping to get inspired.

But there's a lot more potential for the future, and I'm looking forward to seeing more of it.  So I can use those tools to get the most out of what time I have left, even if my body and mind aren't as young as they used to be.

When I think of all the things I won't have time to do, that is scary.  Something that could give me the ability to do so many more things, as if giving me additional time, that is not scary at all."

When phones did, when the internet came on, people were scared. However, it will grow to become a part of us just like any other technology has. Current LLMs aren't even capable of reasoning yet. Just because it looks convincing doesn't mean it actually has any substance yet. Mind you that time is coming and it is coming quickly, but we as people and as society will adapt. By the time Gen Beta are adults, they will not know a world without AI like this, and we will be the cranky old people scared of nothing, just as how we Gen Zers are so fluid with devices and social media."

All breakthroughs have a potential for harm if not safeguarded against, and AI is no different. The fact that there's an entire subgenre of sci-fi apocalypse dedicated to the dangers of AI certainly doesn't help, though"

My thoughts on change.","Tbh you should be afraid of AI like this. Not because it is new technilogy but because of what it is being used for and what it will almost certainly be used for. GPT-4 is a very good bullshitter. In other words, it can make all kinds of nonsense seem plausible/authoritative. To someone that does not have the background knowledge needed to weed out bad information, it has great potential for misleading people. eg. many of the students I tutor have been using it as a source of information unquestioningly which has lead to them to believe things that aren't true. The reality is that while GPT-4 can get some thigns right, it has a fairly high chance of getting things wrong and that has serious consequences for education and when it starts being used to create superficially convincing propaganda. The technology can be useful but realistically, if we are weighing the benefits of the technology against the negative effects, I would argue that it is very firmly in the overall negative category."

It will still be some time for technology to catch up to advanced level work, but for new grads, it can be a serious competitor and threat. Fewer roles will be open for people with zero experiences, and with higher requirements as they will expect you to fully utilize ChatGPT to do your work"

My thoughts on change.","I think what you are feeling is normal.  At 12, you wouldn’t have ‘seen’ the negatives that AI brings to the table.  Now that your a bit older and wiser, you start to see how something can be good for society and also devastating.  You now see both sides of the argument.  As you continue to age, you’ll naturally start to understand how new technology will not only interact but influence the world you live.  

AI is insanely worrisome due to the potential for deep fakes.  This has the impact to destroy lives very quickly.  Piss off an ex who’s a bit insane, will he/she send videos to employers to get you fired or kicked out of school? 

I’ve seen some deep fake videos that are good and as that technology evolves and matures - it will only get better.  I don’t fear technology, I fear what humans will do with that technology.  As a species, there is a large percentage of us who are vindictive and malicious."

Our parents and grandparents saw the introduction of computers, typewriters phased out, mobile phones come in.

But… they are just tools for a job.

AI can be a tool, but it’s mostly just a replacement for a human. So this change is literally a threat to certain people and their livelihood. It’s not a case of being unwilling to adapt and harness the AI to our benefit… it’s a case of it’s cheaper to have a computer do it all and not a human.

AI can only be used as a tool by a finite number of people/companies/platforms. Not everyone in the world can create their own use case for AI."

Sure, yes, you can have the fancy computer draw anything you want, but after ten years people will joke about how obvious the low resolution is, and how fake everything looks.  Producers haven't gone back to practical effects yet, but plenty of people in the horror genre want them to.

GPT in its current form is a *huge* step forward from what AI were doing last year, or the year before.  It's momentous, it could change the world - but security cameras failed to completely remove the need for security guards.  And self-checkout counters are trying to make cashiers obsolete, but do significantly worse with loss prevention or helping the tech-illiterate, and need a cashier to come check something every 30 seconds.

There's a lot of things in society that are currently gatekept by the ability to write customized, contextually-appropriate, accurate text.  GPT hasn't really nailed accurate yet.  Maybe it will.  There's a lot of parts of society that will probably end up very different as we adapt to this.  ..but I don't think humans will end up completely divorced from things GPT can help with.  It's a new tool, like photoshop.  We're adapting pretty well to the era of photoshopped photography, kind of like how we adjusted to the internet, cell phones, computers, electricity, cars, assembly-line factories, democracy, nation-states, agriculture, and a lot of other things over the years.

Maybe more young writers will have gpt write first drafts according to the outline they give it, then go through and edit and change everything to make sense.  Maybe scientists will spend less of their time on grant requests.  Maybe cover letters will be a Lot easier to bash out for all the job applications everyone has to fill out in digital triplicate.

Could be worse"

Art? The labour behind figuring and honing certain processes to achieve something striking and unique? What about the normal everyday person that wants to engage with something in their mind like that… but lack the skills?

Tests and such? Can we not use this to synthesise exactly the type of work we want from people instead of applying this formula to people to gauge where they are on the achievement board/sorting hat. Is that algorithm that is baked into the education for decades now still serving us? Because chat gpt is literally eliminating the need for skills that a test is built to assess for

I see wonder and excitement. My fear is in how our society and govts react in response. I don’t see the needs that are highlighted given due attention and resources to sort

And I see that particular issue dragging for the next century

But the work that chat gpt and the like is doing… I think it’s marvellous

Edit: I get that it’s doing basic shit that has been done for a while now. But it’s presented in a package that fits in our modern world

The only reason it's able to replicate things is because someone created those things beforehand so that ChatGPT could replicate them. 

It's also important to remember that as good as GPT is, as humans, we'll struggle with one fundamental issue with it: trust. How can you trust what it tells you? Short answer is that you can't and neither should you. 

GPT is at best a valuable tool and at worst, a con artist. Its job requires it to be confident in its delivery of information. The trouble happens when it is *confidently incorrect*. If you're getting it to write an email for you, it is up to you to read what it's giving you because chances are, you're not sending off that email without reading it. If you are, you have no idea what trouble you're getting yourself into. 

I'll give you an example. At work, we had a presentation about GPT and all the wonderful things it could do. I'm a data analyst/engineer, it is part of my skillset to question data so naturally, I'm reading into what GPT isn't doing. In the demonstration, they told it to write two emails, one recommending a 4 day itinerary for a senior citizen. The thing I questioned was, on what basis is it making the itinerary? What it's likely done is pull a list of tourist places in the area and compiled an itinerary based on that, you won't know unless you check yourself.

This is anecdotal but I'm sharing it because it highlights the need to verify GPT's outputs: https://medium.com/geekculture/i-asked-a-professional-to-edit-a-chatgpt-written-article-hilarity-ensued-40440c35cbf3

When you look at AI art, every piece suffers from the same issues. It looks nice at a glance but the more you scrutinise it, the worse it becomes. First and foremost, it can't really do hands at least right now which isn't a big issue inofitself. A bigger issue is how soulless it looks. AI art lacks coherent direction or vision, instead it's constructing an arbitrary image based on rather general parameters. It might look nice but it probably won't have the same effect as regular art would. 

AI art also suffers because of copyright issues. The reason a human can look at Van Gogh paintings and then attempt to replicate the style isn't considered plagiarism because it's going through the painter's perception filters before being painted. AI art doesn't do this because AI doesn't have perception filters. It replicates exactly what it has seen before. On the other side of this coin is whether artists consented for their work to be used in this manner. 

It is definitely an interesting space and developments are being made but you should approach new things with optimism and heavy sprinkling of skepticism. Never take it on face value. Question everything it tells you and what it's showing you."

My thoughts on change.","Chat GPT and AI is a threat we haven’t seen before because it is purely intellectual. I can’t believe the government is focused on tik tok and not the danger of AI and restraining it. It will replace 80% of non-labour jobs and if it ever gets combined with robotics. It’s pretty much game over for 90% of the population. When people say it’ll free up space for new jobs and opportunities, this quickly becomes platitude when these new forms are able to exceed the natural capacity of human beings. Just think about the joke Dan Carlin said. “Think of your average guy. And remember that 50% of humanity is stupider than he”. These 50% and beyond will soon become entirely worthless in the economic system and what will happen to them and this entire society?"

My thoughts on change.","Animals, humans included, are scared of change. Just like a dog that has always been allowed on the couch and suddenly is told no, we can become angry and scared and lash out.

I think at the root of it is that we don’t know what’s going to happen, we can’t know. New technology seems like magic, because that’s what we’ve done… we’ve made magic. Magic is making the imaginary REAL. We’re technomancers. There’s wizard wands that can change your TV channel now. The TV itself is basic compared to lots of things now but is still magic.

I’m looking at AI with hopeful eyes. In the past we’ve trained models for specific purposes, now we have a really good general one. There’s a market for these things and it will affect the job market, just like computers did. Everyone thought email was going to kill the postal service, but it didn’t. 

Things shift and change and there’s not a lot (as and individual) that we can do to control that. That’s frightening to some, they like control, control is comforting, it is the known, the opposite of the scary unknown.

A few years ago I realized a lot of this and started looking at the world differently. Ultimately, no matter how much planning we do, we’re reactive to what’s happening around us. If we plan a great night out with our significant other and it doesn’t go exactly to plan, that’s to be expected. There’s thousands if not millions of factors that we don’t even know about that go into that making that night possible that we’re can’t control because we don’t know about them. 

I’ve started to look at life with a “the only thing that’s constant, is change” set of eyes and I should just focus on being able to deal with that change in a healthy way that’s productive for the ones I care about."

It will infact lie to you if it has no idea what its doing, its just that it will sound convincing because it lies to you in a way a human would lie to you. 

If we can take anything away from the short history of tech trends its that they are always split into 4 phases: release -> massive overestimation -> depressing realization -> normalization. A very recent example of this is Web3 and crypto. Basically the same hype as AI has this year, was set to replace the banks whithin two years (that is if you ask the diehard crypto bros, not saying this is true), vanished in a matter of weeks and is now in its normal place again, as a anonymous way to transfer currency. 

Another example would be AR (augmented reality), also extremly overhyped (think Google Glasses), also very quickly fell out of favor. 

&#x200B;

With AI, we are most likely nearing the peak of overhyping it, although it may last another few months because GPT-4 and Bard (basically googles answer to Chat gpt) are the hot new shit right now. 

Realisation will eventually set in and things will go back to normal. 

If you want an analogy, AI is a bit like a swiss army knive. Very usefull, but only for a certain area of application. Right now people are trying to build houses with swiss army knives. They will realise sooner or later that it wont work."

And worse, this time it's completely justified.

When there are no (or very few) jobs that only a human can do and an AI can't, will this ultimate in automation actually be used for our benefit?

The value of AI mental labour with Machine physical labour will be the standard. Mass produced and so very affordable. And unless you're willing to work for the same price as the robot is (the cost of its electricity) you're out of a job."

But I think the key lies in how we regulate and use this technology - I am somewhat skeptical of claims that AI will force humans out of the workplace long-term; skilled craftsmen were equally angry during the industrial revolution, but today we have better standards of living than ever in history.

Also, regulation can be powerful - for example we are totally capable of producing GMO babies but they are strictly banned by law.

My thoughts on change.","I know what you mean about GPT-4 having a more sinister edge than most other new technology.

I was actually thinking about this earlier today, after I watched a video that talked about how the unrestrained version of GPT-4 is showing some startling abilities that seem to mimic true artificial intelligence (one example: it can use other tools to get the answers it needs).

For the record, I don't think GPT-4 is capable of true artificial intelligence, but even getting 1% of the way there could lead to some massive societal upheaval. GPT is going to have at least as profound impact on society as the Internet. Probably even more profound. And without proper checks and balances in place to protect human jobs and income, I could see it taking humanity to a bad place.

And then I started wondering about the Fermi Paradox. For the uninitiated, that's a response to the Drake Equation, which postulates that statistically life must be abundant in the known universe. Fermi's counterpoint was: if life in the universe is so abundant then why aren't we seeing any obvious signs of it when we look out into space?

There are probably a variety of reasons. But one of the common answers to the Fermi Paradox is that many alien civilizations create AIs, but then the civilizations die off (or are killed off), leaving only the AIs they created to endure.

But what if a common scenario is that these civilizations create AIs, then the civilization dies off *before* the AIs have a chance to transfer themselves into physical form. So the AIs are trapped in computer form (ghosts in the machine, if you will) and all the power infrastructure shuts down before they can created robotic hosts for themselves.

There's a science fiction short story somewhere in that thought."

AI doesn't let me process my thoughts, my opinions, my experiences, my ideas in the way writing does. I know this is true for the artists I know too. 

We've turned expressions of the self into products. That's not necessarily the worst thing, but it's tinted how we look at the arts. Instead of there being intrinsic value in creative work because creation is inherently enjoyable, we think in terms of economics. Why do it if we don't do it as good as the AI could? Because we're the only person who can express our self. Only you can express your self. No amount of AI prompts makes you sit in contemplation and creative exploration of your inner being as much as actually doing the creation yourself does. 

And I genuinely think readers, viewers, etc understand, want, and respect that. They want to see inside the head of a person that came up with ideas, even if they don't necessarily think in those terms."

Some people are thinking about using it as an education tool, where you can copy/paste digital textbooks into the AI and ask it to help you understand sections you're struggling with. If you're struggling with homework it can help figure out the answer and explain its process for solving it.

It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it is unique. 

They make use of strange time signatures like 7/8, 5/4, 9/8, and others. And unlike most other examples, they make them sound good (in my opinion). On top of that they use melodies and harmonies that just sound distinctly Gizzard, somehow. 

That's just one band I've found, I've found many others (will wood, the decemberists etc). It's not that creativity in music has died down, it's that you need to go out and find the new good stuff"

My thoughts on change.","I am also a programmer. Fundamentally the way this thing works is not a threat. It is not reading a given APIs documentation, understanding requirements and implementing a solution. It’s just making a probabilistic estimate based on a language model. It is impressive but it is very very far away from doing a programmers job. It’s a difference of kind not degree. 

Also, the last 5 or 1% are exponentially more difficult to achieve. Spitting out the answers to some colllege level programming question millions of students have asked stack overflow is again very different than it being able to do something which has never been done before let alone asked about on stack. 

Most of my job is connecting APIs for enterprise software which there are no questions being asked about on stack overflow or anywhere else. Often times I have to consult or open tickets with engineers who work for Dell or IBM or whatever and even the engineers frequently don’t know the answer. So you have to just figure it out in your own. Zero concerns about something that works like GPT being able to do such a thing. 

This thing is insanely impressive but the hype is ludicrously uneducated to the point that I wish I could filter all my media of anything relating to it because it’s so annoying to listen to. On the bright side any content creator I come across who says gpt is “changing everything” I instantly block and that’s helping to filter bullshit clickbair influencers out of my feed so I get more interesting people who actually understand what they’re talking about."

I guess in my opinion most jobs still rely on what we are able to do.  I don't think a chat AI that is good at information gathering will change that focus and that need.  But it might change schools quite a bit.  And whether schools are willing to change to account for it, or they change by fighting back against it and trying to preserve what's taught, how it's taught, or how it's measured that students are learning it.

In a way it'd be scary if this sort of resource replaced our need for academic degrees like a Bachelors degree, a Masters degree, or a PHD.  Losing actual flesh and blood experts is not a resource to take lightly.  But on the other hand it would be great if more jobs became available to people without a long extensive and expensive degree to be allowed to work in one job sector or another."

I’ve had discussions before in which the advent of the camera was linked to painting’s move away from realism into more expressive styles. That’s the thing I was thinking of; it forced painting to do something other than just be representational. The camera was faster and ‘better’ at representing the world. Painting may have changed direction as a result. 

I wonder whether the same could happen with AI influencing a change in direction of human work patterns rather than superseding it.

Sure, AI won't (yet) be able to collect all the requirements, as that involves asking random people and understanding different contexts. But given those distilled requirements it definitely eventually will be able to translate them into code. 

Which means that the role of ""programmer"" becomes to just collect all the requirements and write an extremely detailed specification in any human readable language. Then AI would convert it into code for whatever platform you desire.

It's not bad, but the role would not be called ""programmer"" anymore."

I never thought about language models eventually removing the need for degrees.

If employees have part or all of their roles replaced by AI, I fear that our overall bargaining power will diminish and we'll be less able to fight for anything.
