YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Large Language Models like ChatGPT or GPT-4 act as a sort of Rosetta Stone for transforming human text into machine readable object formats. I cannot stress how much of a key problem this solved for software engineers like me. This allows us to take any arbitrary human text and transform it into easily usable data.

While this acts as a major boon for some 'good' industries (for example, parsing resumes into objects should be majorly improved... thank god) , it will also help actors which do not have your best interests in mind. For example, say police department x wants to monitor the forum posts of every resident in area y, and get notified if a post meets their criteria for 'dangerous to society', or 'dangerous to others', they now easily can. In fact it'd be excessively cheap to do so. This post for example, would only be around 0.1 cents to parse on ChatGPT's API.

Why do I assert this will happen? Three reasons. One, is that this will be easy to implement. I'm a fairly average software engineer, and I could guarantee you that I could make a simple application that implements my previous example in less than a month (assuming I had a preexisting database of users linked to their location, and the forum site had a usable unlimited API). Two, is that it's cheap. It's extremely cheap. It's hard to justify for large actors to NOT do this because of how cheap it is. Three is that AI-enabled surveillance is already happening to some degree: [https://jjccihr.medium.com/role-of-ai-in-mass-surveillance-of-uyghurs-ea3d9b624927](https://jjccihr.medium.com/role-of-ai-in-mass-surveillance-of-uyghurs-ea3d9b624927)

Note: How I calculated this post's price to parse:

This post has \~2200 chars. At \~4 chars per token, it's 550 tokens.  
550 /1000 = 0.55 (percent of the baseline of 1k tokens)  
0.55 \* 0.002 (dollars per 1k tokens) = 0.0011 dollars.

Why YSK: This capability is brand new. In the coming years, this will be implemented into existing monitoring solutions for large actors. You can also guarantee these models will be run on past data. Be careful with privacy and what you say online, because it will be analyzed by these models."

I have even had instances where I made it crystal clear that nobody was being threatened, and yet the post removed and my account has been restricted.

YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Text Analysis:

The text highlights the potential for large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, to revolutionize surveillance by efficiently parsing and interpreting human text. The author expresses concern about the ease, affordability, and existing instances of AI-enabled surveillance, which could lead to the widespread use of these tools by actors who may not have the best interests of individuals in mind.

Strategy to prevent misuse of LLMs in surveillance:

Raise awareness: Inform the public about the potential risks of AI-powered surveillance, emphasizing the importance of privacy and caution when sharing information online.
Advocate for clear and comprehensive regulations: Lobby for the establishment of legal frameworks that regulate the use of LLMs for surveillance purposes. Encourage strict rules, transparency, and accountability in the deployment of such technologies by government and private entities.
Encourage ethical AI development: Promote the development and adoption of ethical guidelines for AI research and implementation. This includes incorporating privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy and federated learning, in the design of LLMs.
Support privacy-enhancing technologies: Encourage the use of encryption, anonymization, and other privacy-enhancing tools that can help protect individual data and communication from unauthorized access or surveillance.
Monitor and expose misuse: Establish independent watchdog organizations to track and expose cases of AI-powered surveillance misuse. These organizations can help hold governments and corporations accountable for any violations of privacy or human rights.
Develop and promote alternative, privacy-preserving AI applications: Support research into AI technologies that enhance privacy, rather than compromise it. Encourage the development of AI applications that empower users and protect their privacy.
Promote digital literacy: Educate the public on the importance of digital privacy and security, as well as ways to safeguard their personal information online. This includes teaching individuals how to evaluate the credibility of websites, use strong passwords, and avoid sharing sensitive information on public forums.
By implementing these strategies, we can help mitigate the risks associated with the misuse of LLMs in surveillance, promoting a more privacy-conscious society that values individual rights and freedoms."

And the monitoring example you gave, literally already happens right now, without AI.

This tech is extremely expensive, and even basing it off OpenAI models with API requests would require significant tweaking and tuning to be used in the way you described.

AI isn't easily weaponised because it takes a *long* time for it to get up and running, and I doubt it'll replace a human just spying on you, it's far cheaper, and doesn't require fancy tech.

I'd only worry about facial recognition and mass-surveillance, and AI has been used for both of those things for like, the past 5-10 years, and can be easily defeated."

However it is becoming mulit-model. So it can do pictures video ect.  What it can do the. Is instead of acting as a trigger, i could ask it to summarize everything you have been up to today and get a summary without having to watch everything or read a bunch of transcripts and it can summarize pictures you looked at, videos you watched etc.

YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Focusing on raising awareness and advocating for clear and comprehensive regulations can efficiently address the potential misuse of large language models (LLMs) in surveillance. A 5-step plan to start implementing these strategies could be:

The time required to complete all five steps will vary depending on several factors, such as the complexity of the issue, the level of existing awareness, the receptiveness of policymakers, and the resources available to the coalition. However, a rough estimate for the completion of each step could be:

Form a coalition: 1-3 months
Building a coalition of diverse stakeholders requires time to identify, contact, and secure commitments from the participants.
Develop clear messaging: 1-2 months
Crafting a compelling and concise narrative requires research, collaboration, and feedback from stakeholders.
Conduct awareness campaigns: 3-12 months
Awareness campaigns can take time to plan, execute, and measure their impact. The duration will depend on the scale and scope of the campaign, as well as the resources available for promotion and engagement.
Draft policy proposals: 3-6 months
Developing comprehensive policy proposals requires research, consultation with experts, and collaboration among stakeholders to ensure the proposals are well-founded and practical.
Engage with policymakers: 6-24 months
Engaging with policymakers can be a lengthy process, as it involves building relationships, presenting proposals, and advocating for change. The time required will depend on the complexity of the issue, the legislative agenda, and the willingness of policymakers to address the concerns.
Considering these estimates, the entire process could take anywhere from 1 to 3 years to complete all steps. However, it's essential to recognize that these steps may also overlap, and the actual time required will depend on the specific circumstances and resources available."

 >Roko's basilisk is a thought experiment which states that an otherwise benevolent artificial superintelligence (AI) in the future would be incentivized to create a virtual reality simulation to torture anyone who knew of its potential existence but did not directly contribute to its advancement or development. It originated in a 2010 post at discussion board LessWrong, a technical forum focused on analytical rational enquiry. The thought experiment's name derives from the poster of the article (Roko) and the basilisk, a mythical creature capable of destroying enemies with its stare.

YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Predicting the exact chances of preventing the implementation of AI-powered surveillance within three years is challenging, as it depends on various factors, such as the speed of technological advancements, public awareness, policy changes, and the actions taken by governments and corporations. However, some factors can influence the likelihood of success:

Public sentiment: The success of efforts to prevent AI-powered surveillance will depend on the level of public awareness and concern about the issue. If the public is well-informed and actively engaged in advocating for privacy, it is more likely that policymakers will take the matter seriously and implement necessary regulations.
Policy progress: Success will also depend on the pace at which new policies are developed and enacted. If comprehensive regulations addressing AI-powered surveillance are implemented swiftly, it is more likely that the deployment of threatening technology can be prevented or limited.
International cooperation: Surveillance technology does not respect borders, and as such, international collaboration is essential. If countries can work together to establish global standards and share best practices, the likelihood of preventing or mitigating the threat of AI-powered surveillance will increase.
Technological advancements: The development of privacy-preserving technologies and AI applications that empower users can help counterbalance the risks posed by AI-powered surveillance. If such technologies advance rapidly and are widely adopted, they may help offset the potential threats.
Corporate responsibility: If technology companies prioritize ethical considerations and incorporate privacy by design principles, they can play a crucial role in preventing the misuse of AI-powered surveillance technology. Corporate responsibility initiatives can help foster a more privacy-conscious industry.
While it is difficult to quantify the exact chances of preventing the implementation of threatening AI-powered surveillance technology within three years, the combined efforts of stakeholders, policymakers, and the public can significantly increase the likelihood of success."

An AI (if it can be called that at that point) like that would understand that humans are incredibly influenced by their nature. Lazy, can't see far into the future, and afraid of new things. First of all, it would thus be irrational to even expect humans to contribute to its' creation. 

Secondly, torturing the ""humans"" who did not help its' creation is in itself an irrational action, as it contributes nothing to the fact beside gratification, which, if we are to believe it to be completely rational, is absolute nonsense.

Any usable quantum computing is just so drastically beyond our current reach I highly doubt there are any humans on earth with it.

edit:
Besides, NIST and the NSA already make all the determinations about which algorithms are used by everybody. They literally have contests for new algorithms, then privately analyze and determine which one they're going to force everyone else to standardize to. If the government wanted backdoors in encryption it's millions of times more likely that they're just sneaking them in during their private, closed-door determinations and analysis then that they're letting extremely difficult to crack schemes past because they've leapfrogged quantum computing technology by decades."

You’re right government is behind in a lot of areas. But that’s because other nations are using their best people to try to break in to every Gov system every millisecond of every day. I worked at various NOCs and I know. 

Your shitty SaaS startup has nothing valuable worth their time. So you can fail with little repercussion."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Why not? The left hand almost never knows what the right hand is doing when it comes to government. Misuse of info occurs all the time, and not just maliciously, sometimes its just mistakes.

I consider my anal sphincter to be the smartest muscle in my body, but it has still mishandled information at least once; at the most inconvenient time too."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"You've never used a self checkout that didn't have a camera, that's where all the theft happens. Walmart has cameras on the self checkout that will alert via the screen if you 'forget' to ring something in, reminding you to double check."

YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,👀
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"r/JusticeServed also banned me but for commenting in a group that “promotes biological terrorism” (r/conservative). They would lift the ban if I promised to never engage in that subreddit again. I told that mod that while I had little love for r/conservative, I had less love for internet strangers trying to bully me into complying with their politics (even if it’s politics I typically agree with)."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,It's also likely the government requires some chip manufacturers to backdoor their random number generators to steal encryption key info too
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"> I'd be glad to be proved wrong

Well I felt better until the second part of your comment, that makes way more sense. Why build the technology to break down the door when you can just have someone steal you the keys."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"> If the government wanted backdoors in encryption it's millions of times more likely that they're just sneaking them in

I'm just an average idiot but from what I understand about modern encryption, there aren't really ""backdoors"" unless you have advanced mathematics that others don't, which I assume is highly unlikely."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"That's not true. I have worked for a company that installed self checkouts without cameras. They do have cc footage from above that records people as well as an attendant watching all of the check outs.

Walmart seems to be one of the first stores to have cameras that displays a live feed of you using it. When you google self check out cameras, walmart is pretty much the main story for every article. There are also articles talking about companies added add-on cameras to their self check outs pretty much proving your theory wrong of every checkout having a preinstalled camera.[https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/03/princeton-university-dps-store-surveillance-camera-avoid-shoplifting](https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2023/03/princeton-university-dps-store-surveillance-camera-avoid-shoplifting)"
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"There’s an article that also serves as an interview piece with Peter Thiel. In this article, Thiel referred to the working class as “lazy” because they won’t innovate and produce enough to make him more money and keep the industries he’s invested and personally interested in soaring with technological advancements. So, his brilliant proposal to fix this “issue” is by removing all forms of leizure activities and hobbies from being accessible by the working class in order to prevent them from doing anything else other than innovate and work.

Didn’t even pause in listing what activities he’d have made illegal to get this done, including: playing sports, having parties, bars, clubs, hobbies such as art and music creation, playing video or board games, reading for pleasure, psychedelics specifically as well. Like, dude definitely knows he’s evil as shit lmao. He  doesn’t even try to hide it because he’s probably confident he’s too rich and connected to be stopped. Pretty much the only billionaire that I know of that truly gives me the absolute creeps, cold-blooded as fuck."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"It's been known for a couple years now that the ""Intel Management Engine"" actually functions as a backdoor into the lowest level processing of a computer, and any computer containing a consumer CPU has it enabled, and set so that it cannot be disabled or reduced. It's a permanent backdoor to the very core of probably nearly every computer you use.

https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/05/intels-management-engine-security-hazard-and-users-need-way-disable-it"
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever, Isn't that why keygens require entropy?
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Or better yet, ""partner"" (force under implied threat of prosecution) with the lock manufacturer so you never even need to steal them. This is essentially what all governments are doing now."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"IIRC it's more like hardware/software access that allows side-stepping the encryption completely.

This would be hardware/software dependent obviously, but there are plenty of ways attackers could gain admin access to practically any device."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Well, the math is certainly advanced. Like, very advanced. And the process is very very long and complicated. But it does involve some set properties. Like there's specific numbers of turns, numbers of iterations, lookup tables for splicing and things. All of these parameters can be modified and only specific parameters will give high security. Sorta like if you had 5 door locks but they were all the same they wouldn't be better than one, but also drastically more complicated than that. Predicting the outcomes of these parameters is very very difficult and some would say basically impossible, that's why these algorithms work. If we knew exactly how to deconstruct it, it'd be trivial to break keys. So what I mean is that it's totally possible that somewhere in the very long, extremely complicated, nigh incomprehensible path that your information takes from plain text to encrypted, that somewhere there's a single bit, or a couple numbers that have been specifically chosen so that the process is much much quicker if you come at it from one specific direction. Not so much a back door but like a tiny brick in a mile long wall that lets you walk through and skip half the maze.

The term backdoor can refer to the simple, ""I put a master key in"", or the, ""I used Galois theory of the elliptic curve group to design in a bit trap in the mix columns that uses a specific set of mix keys to reduce the computational complexity by half and allow us to break any key in 24 days instead of 1000 years."" type thing. It's heavy math and shit, the public's understanding of encryption beyond the most basic usage is fairly disconnected from the modern reality."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Those are integrated cameras on the self checkouts themselves, but even walmart SCOs are surrounded by cameras on the ceilings angled at your face despite having something like three cameras integrated directly on the machine.

It was the same deal back when Walmart was just staffed checkouts, too. Every register had the single camera directly above to watch the till, but there are several others angled in a number of different directions. If some sort of theft happens, the surveillance system doesn't do much good unless there is a clear image of the perpetrator's face."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,So if this is a widely known backdoor then how is everything at all times not being hacked? How are bored script kiddie teenagers not putting porn on theatre screens and TV networks and work displays for shits and giggles? There's no way this is as bad as you make it sound because the world would just collapse.
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,So how do we disable it? Asking for educational purposes.
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"Very good analogy yes.

Utterly dystopian and painful to know that even the modern FOSS movement could likely do anything as we're talking about things on the hardware level."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"It's an internal Intel tool. They have the keys and nobody else does. Presumably they have them locked down very well but the fact that they even have the keys is the problem. It's not like they're using it to spy on 300 million americans, they already have ISPs and more to do that. This tool is like if you were a special political dissident and encrypted your computer and had very good OpSec, the government could ask intel to give them the keys in and own your computer in no time. Intel would be forced to comply with a warrant or a subpoena, they would fold instantly. There's been serious conversations that the government might've been the people who asked intel to make the keys in the first place.

As well, the dissemination of extremely fundamental security vulnerabilities doesn't really work like that. There's multi million if not billion dollar industries built around security vulnerabilities. If someone compromised the Intel IME keys they would sell that information for a hundred million  dollars to the highest bidder nation state. That nation state would then require the individual selling it to destroy any copy that they had so that the nation state would have all the power and know that no-one could use it against them. Nation states have many many many security vulnerabilities that don't get disseminated widely to script kiddies and darknet markets. As well, no script kiddie is going to try to run some IME hack on your computer, it's nontrivial for a person to execute but would be easily done by a government. There's much easier ways for a kid or really any individual human to own computers. Phishing, social engineering, all the things we see that are popular today. Those are all the popular things for a reason, they're what people can do.

And finally last reason that this isn't getting used en mass is that every sophisticated organization knows that if they let their usage become an obvious problem, it will force the company to close the back door/change the keys/issue recall. If you've got a net with access to a hundred political dissidents phones, it would be stupid to start installing it on library computers and other people's infrastructure. Sooner or later a sophisticated individual is going to see it, raise the alarm, and then the party's over.

The real risk with the IME isn't that whoever is using it to access everybody's data, or even just your data. It's probably used very sparingly and there's other easier ways to get in. The problem is that the easier ways to access can be thwarted. If you're smart enough and paranoid enough you can avoid all the emails and downloads and shit. You can boot off your own software, use burners, encrypt, do all the things you should do. The real risk of the IME is that it cannot be stopped. You can't prevent whoever has the keys from getting in, no matter what you do. If your computer can communicate with any other computer, you can't stop it. That's the real danger."
YouShouldKnow,YSK: The Future of Monitoring.. How Large Language Models Will Change Surveillance Forever,"lmao, would it work how they want if you could disable it? It's not some code or software running in windows or something, no matter how sophisticated you get you can't just flip a registry key or something. It's literally silicon on the board. It's built in to the physical chip. No one has any to disable it besides partnering with the manufacturer to ensure your government computers don't have it enabled. 

The only potential avenue for disabling it (you can't remove it) is that it has to run somewhere, if there's functionality to get into your computer, even if it's physical switches inside you cpu, for anyone to use it it has to interact with the computer in some way. Unfortunately the only way it interacts is via BIOS Firmware. Have you ever installed a BIOS Firmware not supplied by the manufacturer? It's a very fast way to brick your computer. No one has any simple way to disable it and even the extremely complicated ways that require Doctorate levels of electrical engineering specializing in computer CPU and low level architecture would be *extremely* risky and essentially like trying to stack bricks on top of a 20 tall tower of needles, 1 thick. It's just not possible for us.

Get ready for the future where the company who makes the product you buy own it and not you, it's basically already here."
