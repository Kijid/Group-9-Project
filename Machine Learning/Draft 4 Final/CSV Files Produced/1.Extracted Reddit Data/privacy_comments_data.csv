privacy,Facial recognition for public surveillance is beyond creepy.,"This is just the beginning. As AI gets stronger and cameras get better resolution these systems will get to the point where they know you better than your friends. We're talking about highly astute systems that are like Sherlock Homes on steroids.

They will know:

 - You're right handed.
 - You need to squint to read text at a certain distance.
 - Your limp is gone, but now there's a band-aid on your left hand.
 - The speed in which you read indicates average intelligence at best.
 - You check out blonde girls more than any other group, and not always ones that are over 18.
 - You wear cheap pants and shirts, but you own at least four pairs of high-end shoes, and three watches with an estimated combined value of $12,000.
 - You have checked your watch 11 times in the last hour.
 - Your pupils are constricted again - your addiction to pain killers is getting worse. Your need to blow your nose suggests you're now insufflating the pills.
 - Your gait suggests something heavy in the back right of your pants, likely a heavy pistol.

They will keep getting better and more accurate forever, and retain that information for decades. Eventually they'll be used to prevent crime.

 - This person is super drunk and just got behind the wheel.
 - This person experiences road rage on a daily basis, and is going to get someone killed.
 - This person has been looking at prospective sniper nests around the city, and is planing a mass shooting."
privacy,Facial recognition for public surveillance is beyond creepy.,"What scares me is that even *if* we, as societies, manage to stop China-like state surveillance (and that's a big if), we're probably still doomed by private companies incentivising individuals to collect the recognition data anyway. Yes, Google Glass flopped, but something like it will reappear. How many ""I don't care, I have nothing to hide"" kind of people do you think won't accept funneling face recognition data back to MegaCorp in exchange for a reduced service charge? Now it doesn't matter if the state isn't surveilling the street – helpful volunteers will passively keep track of you.

We need to be ahead of the curve here. Such activities need to be clearly outlawed right now, before it becomes too profitable to ban."

privacy,Facial recognition for public surveillance is beyond creepy.,"It will be worse than that. You are thinking too small.

In psychology there are lots of studies about 'implanting false memories' and how to convince people to behave a certain way, etc. 

So not only will these AI systems know everything about you, but it will know how to manipulate you subconsciously. In fact, they will know how to manipulate large groups of people, even entire nations. 

And most importantly, it will know the exact moment you form a thought that is not approved of and you will find yourself taking a trip to room 101. All that research on micro expressions, for example....

And these are just things that we already know how to do today. Imagine a general intelligence AI that could think and discover like a human brain does? They will come up with ideas that are so beyond our understanding that it will be like an ant trying to comprehend nuclear power.
