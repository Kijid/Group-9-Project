Presumably, this device has to send the evidence it collects to a human officer to verify before they can get a conviction. The ECHR already ruled that automated convictions based on AI alone violate the right to a fair trial. Essentially, this type of technology just means that instead of a police officer sitting watching traffic all day, they can instead set the AI up and go and work on more serious crimes and check what they caught later. Given the current underfunded state of our police service, this is actually a great solution: you can make the roads safer by monitoring more of them(and let's be real catching more people since the AI is probably more reliable) and tax money isnt wasted paying police officers to sit and watch cameras all day."

technology,Police in England installed an AI camera system along a major road. It caught almost 300 drivers in its first 3 days.,"There are too many variables for AI to enforce. Trucks are allowed in the left lane for passing only. I don't think AI can judge a truck making a passing maneuver VS just driving in the left lane for an extended period of time.

I am a truck driver, and there is a large margin of distance on when to overtake another vehicle in a semi. Leaving anywhere between 60-140ft is usually the space I leave between my truck and another vehicle when I merge back into the right lane. 

Also, I think that technology could be put to better use than enforcing a law that doesn't do much harm. I understand weight laws, and most of them are to prevent damage to the left lane. Which doubles as traffic control for smaller vehicles to get where they need to go, but we got a job to do. Might take about a solid minute to pass another vehicle cause most of our trucks are governed anywhere between 63-65mph. 

I want to say sorry on behalf of all truckers out there for those guys who want to cruise in the left lane all damn day. I don't like those guys as much as anyone else :("

technology,Police in England installed an AI camera system along a major road. It caught almost 300 drivers in its first 3 days.,"Yes it does. People do things based on an internal risk analysis. If they know for a fact there’s a red light camera, they’re going to avoid running it because the risk of getting a ticket is extremely high even if a cop doesn’t see them. If there’s no camera, they’re more willing to run it because it’s a much lower risk that they’ll get in trouble and get a ticket. 

Having cameras to cite people with a 95% chance of being cited if you commit the crime is going to make people not want to get the ticket and therefore not commit the infraction.

Ideally you change the infrastructure to prevent accidental red light running, but if it’s still happening then a camera can catch the remaining people who more than likely run it on purpose and make them stop. 

If you’re texting and driving, you’re not doing it by accident. So cameras are one of few ways to catch people and cite them and prevent future occurrences if they know cameras are watching them."

Speed traps only cause more danger in your scenario if you are already speeding. At that point, if you are already speeding, to avoid the danger you should just accept being caught as a speeder instead of trying to rapidly slow down, if you are so bothered about avoiding danger. There are plenty of things you should do to be a safe driver.

The majority of drivers are going somewhere between 0-10 mph faster than the speed limit on any given highway unless there’s traffic. They all notice the speed trap at once and begin slowing down and trying to switch lanes. Speed traps not only are a poor deterrent they actually cause drivers to engage in riskier behavior. You can say they should act otherwise but that doesn’t have any bearing on how real people actually behave.

But what you say is not true, because your car doesn't actually just ""sit at"" 2k RPM because if the engine is in a particular gear at a constant RPM and the drivetrain is not slipping (i.e. clutch or tyres) then you are going at a constant speed. So either you're doing 40mph at 2k rpm and accelerating to 42mph takes you to 2.1k RPM, or you're doing 42mph at 3k rpm and you're sitting at 2.9k RPM at 40mph."

Proportionally to your increase in speed.

(Though the increased danger is obviously not *linear*, one meaning of ""proportional"", but for small increments that's a fine approximation)

>Source?

If you ask for a source for something which the following statements explain it doesn't look good.

>It is no more dangerous to stop a car going 50mph than to stop one going 45mph if you're driving safely in both scenarios.

At 50mph your stopping distance is 9m further than at 45 mph, which means that if something suddenly obstructs the lane ahead, there are 9 metres of additional danger zone. If you hit it without having had a chance to react and step on the brake yet, you will be travelling with an extra approximately 95 kJ of energy which can be imparted to the fallen tree, child, swerving motorcyclist or whatever. Unless you wish to argue that the danger of this happening whenever you drive the extra 5mph is actually zero - which you have yet to do - this is an increased likelihood of a bad outcome happening, and a worse severity of outcome when it does.

>Never said it did.

You implied it did when you said that a motivation for having blanket speed limits rather than assessing all speeding case-by-case was because ""police need easy revenue."" Again, not a good look to deny this.

>You may argue that restricting nanny-state tech intrusion and protecting privacy is ""less effect"" but I would argue the opposite.

If police have to assess the risk every time they want to prosecute someone for speeding, they will be able to do so less: that is less effect; less deterrent on motorists who want to travel too fast, because the likelihood of getting caught will be lower, because police are spending less time catching speeders and more time justifying that those caught posed a significant enough danger. By the way, this piece of the conversation was about speed limits, not about technology - you've got mixed up."

But if you have Google Maps up and you grab your phone from the side seat and bring it up into your vision to see how many streets ahead before you need to make a right, that's unsafe and you should have a computer camera shoved up your ass to send an immediate fine?

If it's a really big deal for you, you have the option to buy a vehicle with different gear ratios or a better clutch.

But to be honest, the way you describe it makes me think that you've got yourself used to shifting at a certain speed and are justifying why that speed is a bit over the limit, rather than this being any real issue. In a six-speed gearbox I'd expect to shift to fourth while doing 30mph, (i.e. it's weird that, in a 7-speed, you're waiting until 40mph) and have never heard of anyone needing to speed up a bit to make their shifting smoother. You probably just need to let the clutch out more gradually. If that helps, then it's not as if accelerating will save clutch wear - the clutch has to do more work if the engine is going faster, even if the car is also going faster.

Yes, it is.  This conversation is about installing AI camera systems to catch people speeding.  It's about creating a police state that says context doesn't matter, the rule of law matters and we will do everything black and white and whether something is actually bad or dangerous or not, we don't care because the algorithm doesn't care.

So yeah, if you go 51mph instead of 50mph down that empty stretch of highway at night boom, satellite AI cameras watching your roads will send you a nice little $500 ticket that will be waiting by time you get home.

That's the future that happens when we say, ""Yeah just go ahead and film the roads at all times and let computers police us and start catching and fining motorists for every infraction.""

Humans are not perfect, humans make mistakes, and AI *will* catch absolutely all of those mistakes.  But not all of those mistakes are harmful or dangerous or pose any threat to our society at all.  And so they don't deserve to be punished by an unthinking algorithm designed to follow the letter of the law.

Police should be tasked with keeping us safe and using their own judgement and context in conjunction with the law to do so.

No new mother should have to come home from the hospital with her baby and start filing appeals in court to fight the traffic ticket her husband was issued by a fuckin robot because he was driving 5mph over the limit while rushing his wife to the hospital.

There is no source about small increases in speed that they cite nor any study or information on it.  Furthermore they make ridiculous claims like ""An average speed reduction of 1mph reduces crash frequency by 5%"" without anything to back it up which is silly.  Reduction from what?  If you're going 2mph you are 5% less likely to crash than 1mph?  If you're going 220mph you're 5% less likely to crash than 221mph?

No.  Freedom and privacy are more important than life itself.  That's why so many millions have fought and died for those rights and continue to do so.

To make a slippery slope argument you have to actually show how doing the one thing makes the second thing easier. Also cameras do ""film and police us"" in your own view so apparently we're off the cliff already."
technology,Police in England installed an AI camera system along a major road. It caught almost 300 drivers in its first 3 days.,In this case o don’t care as I said if we stop 98 percent of people from texting and driving we’re making roads much safer

You are causing people to be either belligerent or str8 up lie about how much they text and drive. Clearly ain’t stopping shit but if all you know is punishment you’ll find actual change doesn’t require much violence (financial/otherwise)

Use your brain yea there’s a portion of the population that has huge legal teams and unlimited money. Let’s call it 10 percent. This measure is preventing 90 percent from texting and driving because the fees will hurt and they need their license. That’s a huge win to me. Period. Yea the system can be better but at least it works to a point better than not having the camera. 
Enough said bye. You’re one of those that wants the perfect or else won’t take anything. Life doesn’t work like that. Just cause it won’t stop everyone doesn’t mean you’re not gonna try and do something… god it’s so logical but people like you can’t get it"

If it becomes widespread and more people get fines they’ll think twice before doing it again. Lol can’t believe I have to explain this have a good day I won’t respond anymore this is silly
