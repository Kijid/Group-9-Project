AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Mildly (I’m a copywriter). At this point, I actually use it at work, and it has been very helpful. If I get fired, they’ll have to get someone else to input stuff and edit whatever response it comes up with"
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I'm not scared, but it's definitely coming for my job (web developer). I already use an AI to help with coding, it just saves time but still really error prone. That part will only get better. 

The people who should be scared are middle-management; people whose job is to provide oversight and enforce rules with no power to make them. The technology to do their jobs already works, and it's cheap."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,Not at all. I'm a massage therapist
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,Until they develop one that's reliably good at bullshitting then I'm fine
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I was a soldier. If the computers want to fight then I say let them.

Now I'm retired. I don't know what the AI version of that would be except for maybe unplugging them but if they want to give it a shot then I'd let them.

Edit: w to y."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all, I am a social worker. There is nothing wrong with AI doing some basic support and pointing people to the right places. I think they could do wonders in helping people fill out forms. And perhaps some people would trust an AI more then a human since they are unbiased. However, there are always people who want to talk to a human. And AI is terrible at giving philosophical advice or understanding human emotions and feeling. It can identify them, but it can't 'feel' them.

And my side job is organizing psychedelic walking tours. No way an AI can replace that."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all. It might eventually, but by that time I'll be ready to retire anyways."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all. I teach early years so I'd guess it'd be impossible for AI to replace me.

Now, struggling to make ends meet because my job pays a pittance? That concerns me."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I’m not worried right now, more worried about ten years from now when I’m in my late 50s and less employable."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I'm not frightened of AI (not for my job, at least). However, I am part of an ***automation*** team that actively works to ensure we do not need to hire more people as we grow, and it's working very well. 

Automation will kill at least as many jobs as AI, IMO."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,Im a nurse and going in the next year in the Direktion of phys Assistent . Dont think i will be replace in my Lifetime without a gigantic Leap in AI/robotics

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,Scared? Not. Concerned? Mildly. But I am adjusting to the direction tech goes as I always have.

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I’m in public transport so who knows.  I’m not concerned it will directly replace me, but if half the people in office based jobs are now working from home and the other half are in danger of being made redundant by Chat GPT and it’s mates then I’m rapidly running out of customers."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I’m not concerned.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not very scared, as the people who want to use AI for my job weren't my target market in the first place.

On the other hand, the client pool *has* lessened a lot because of AI, but I think that the people using it for content won't feel the possible downsides for some time.

The issue is if they do not know why their content is failing in the first place (generic AI content that anyone can generate won't get clicks for long these days.) 

In that scenario, they might think the business model itself has failed or is no longer viable, and so it won't bring business back to not ""pure AI"" positions."

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I'm looking at being a pilot and I don't think robots will be doing that too soon
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I think AI should be used as a tool by workers. Jobs should be protected.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Ai will most assuredly replace customer service and very shortly, I think. It will not be able to repair bicycles, motorbikes and cars until robots or androids become more available though and that will not come to pass in my lifetime.

Also, theres no hope in sight. A light before us dies. Aligned the horrified. No hope in sight."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"AI could replace my job if it were programmed in a very specific way. However, for it to replace me, it would have to deal with input from people who are not too tech savvy because they need physical labor skills more than tech skills (utility industry) and would run into so many problems. So theoretically it could, but probably won't, or by the time it does, it won't matter to me."

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Eventually an AGI (artificial general intelligence) will become a back bone in the work force and the data from those millions and millions of users will feed into the evolution of an ASI (artificial super intelligence)

Combine that with a general bipedal robot that can do general labor, work as a hive mind, ect. Then you have a means of production that creates it's own means of production. Replace humans in the chain of production that is required to build robots, raw material, manufacturing, transport, then BANG you can make AAAALOT of robots fast.

That with an ASI designing it's own hardware, making scientific discoveries as fast as a machine gun, not just designing parts of a machine but the whole machine, that will drastically shorten all research and development.

In short yha it's all gonna change. I would compare this new technological age to The Elder Scrolls alchemy system. The next decade is gonna be interesting."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,None! Have fun trying to replace a student...
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Being a teacher, not very. But I amn very worried about a lot of professions.

Every job using a computer is fucked. 

Just remember what AI was five years ago, what it is now and then think about what it will be in five years time."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not worried at all

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I’ll be one of the first to go for sure. I’m one of the many peons at an Amazon warehouse.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Oh i personally hope that in the long run most jobs can be replaced and automated. Mine included. Finally changes an already flawed system and we will adapt. However, i guess a lot of people don't want anything to change and are therefore rightfully scared"

Not really worried."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all (funeral director). Putting aside the emotional side of things, people are so desperately afraid of death that techbros don't even consider it when deciding what they're going to fuck around with next so we've been pretty much consistently left alone.

The funeral industry is so ignored, we're still using office software from the 90s, and embalming technology that's even older. Every aspect is so vibes-based, and held together with duct tape, AI won't know where to start."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I am doing retraining for a career in healthcare. I don't see how any machine or program could do the job I do.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all, really. I sell tickets for sports games, and I plan on quitting anyway. I also sometimes operate scoreboards, and that'd take a lot of coding."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I work in TV animation

The producers make the calls, but the artists are there to take their ideas and make them acceptable to an audience. 

Sometimes it involves a lot of battling. The artists tend to be concerned about what the audience would want, but I've never met a producer who cared about that.

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"It's going to be a long time before it replaces my career. My fear is that, with what it can do in the short term, it will replace some tasks, pushing us into a narrower set of viable skills/knowledge, reducing the available positions, increasing competition for them, and thus reducing pay/benefits/QoL."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"As a employee of Sky Net I'm not worried at all.

How about you."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not really at all, I’m a weed grower. I’m sure robots could do it but realistically it’s a pretty intricate physical job beyond just the knowledge aspect and I just don’t see robotics getting to that point anytime soon and costing less than i do"
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I am not scared that AI will take my job, but I am worried that it will lower the entry point so much, that It won't be profitable anymore. Especially if you combine this trend with globalisation and  a market for white collar workers moving to poorer countries due to remote work."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"HSE Officer; and I haven't really thought about it. I suppose it could take over the field pretty easily as a lot of our work is looking for and at trends, and monitoring people and worksites."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"As a statistician, I know I'll be replaced in a lot of my current tasks. It is presumptuous to think that humans can build better statistical models than machines given just a couple of loops & some benchmark data. But then again this has been the case for several years now, you could argue even for more than 30 years. What scares me about the future of my job is the uncertainty: Will I just automate my current job? Will I explain models to people? Will I prompt models? Will I supervise model application? In which direction do I want to go?"
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all, I hope AI and machines replace ALL careers and humans are no longer required to work."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,Right now I'm considering being an artist or an accountant. So either very or not at all
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,i will find a way to convince it to let me keep my career. No worries
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I’m a professional musician and I’m not very worried. DJs didn’t fully replace us so I don’t see AI doing it either. Although AI is already replacing DJs!
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Not at all. I work in construction. Useless they can program robots to build houses, I doubt it."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"> If I get fired

Don't worry about that. Companies are actually looking for people that know how to us AI in their job. So learn to use it and put it on your resume.

AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I bet the FAA will require just one instead of two pilots within 10 years with advanced autopilot picking up the slack. That cuts a lot of people from the workforce.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,My sweet summer child. “Should” has nothing to do with it.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"I worked for a huge cinema chain for years. Once we made the switch to all digital projection systems, I was made redundant. They maintained a small team of “digital technicians” to deal with hard drives and to create playlists.

A couple of years later and films were all delivered by satellite or over the internet. Playlists are created by one person at head office and sent to each individual media server. Once the playlist is complete it automatically transfers itself to the projector storage in the correct auditorium.

Managers have been shown how to replace xenon lamps, but most maintenance is now carried out once every six months. So without even bringing AI into the conversation, automation ended up making the role of the projectionist entirely redundant.

That same cinema has also closed its box office. Tickets can be bought at the concession stand, but they encourage you to buy tickets online. You can also pre-pay for food and simply collect it when you arrive.

I agree that AI probably won’t replace every role in a cinema. Robotic cleaners probably aren’t good enough as it stands to replace a human, but you better believe that the big chains are looking for a way to reduce costs.

I still miss that job sometimes. I met some of my best friends at that cinema."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Many plants are grown nearly full automatic today (e.g. the tomatoes farms). What's so complicated when it comes to weed, that this won't change over then next 10 or 20 years?"
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I'm sorry. I feel I've seen the future and it's dark. HR will not be a refuge either.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,What would you suggest?  I think going into medicine is a little late at this point.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,Ai means artificial intelligent. Meaning its intelligence is uploaded and always needs and upgrade. But mine is natural and i can think of something different in 2 seconds. It needs someone else to think for it. It can never be 100%. And its still sad that people need jobs and yet they're manufacturing something to take over human lives.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"Oh yea, I am fully aware that low skill Jobs like being a cinema host will eventually be replaced by AI, but until it's cheaper for the cinema to have AI cinema hosts, my job is secure."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,It’s weird to feel like you’ve suddenly become unskilled labor.
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I'm beginning to think AI is already more intelligent than you
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,"You absolutely, 100% do not understand what AI is or how computers work in general. 



> i can think of something different in 2 seconds

AI can think of millions of different things in a nanosecond. It learns from it's mistakes it gets more intelligent as it is being used. You, are a static human. You will absolutely be passed in brain power within your lifetime. It's already happening. 

>  It needs someone else to think for it.

That literally, and I mean literally makes no sense. It is what it is. There is no man behind the curtain. 

Have you used ChatGTP

...

> its still sad that people need jobs and yet they're manufacturing something to take over human lives.

No, companies that like making money will always want to do it more efficiently. Always. Lastly, they aren't taking lives, they are taking jobs."
AskReddit,How scared are you of AI replacing your career?,I worked 10 years in the magazine/print industry. I've kinda been here before.
