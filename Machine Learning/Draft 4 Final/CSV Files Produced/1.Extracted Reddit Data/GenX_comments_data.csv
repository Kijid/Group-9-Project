GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I'm a young Gen-X. My job is in Information Technology. New tech has never put me off and I've embraced the rapid advancements in stride. I may bitch about it, but ultimately just roll with the changes, adapt, and keep going. (As is the way of the X)

I've kept an eye on AI's progress and infiltration into online experiences. In the last 6 months or so, it seems like we've reached a point where AI is beginning to displace human content.

I'm seeing more and more images that are AI created, nearly indistinguishable from human made content, being presented as personal works or real images taken in the world.

I've searched for information, only to be presented with articles that are clearly written using AI.

Anyone can take a sample of someone else's voice, and form it into whatever they want that voice to say, and while it's not there yet as far as it being indistinguishable, it's come a very long way in a short period of time. The same can be said of AI manipulated videos.

&#x200B;

Look, I'm no curmudgeon of technology and don't go around saying ""Things were better in MY day"", but looking ahead 5-10 years, I think humanity is in for another massive paradigm shift in the living experience... and more of it bad than good. As we've seen with the internet in general, all things succumb to being manipulated for money and power.

Art, of most modern forms, will no longer be the labor of creative love which imbues it with soul and value. Instead, anything you want will be produced with a few prompts, guide images and instructions. Being a digital artist or musician is already being replaced, with the AI content filling the demand.

Actors, actresses, Voice acting, script writing... all of it is starting to be in the realm of possibility with the current technology.

While this is depressing to an extent, it's not what gives me a bad feeling that I've not had about technology before.

What really alarms me is this:

Imagine if the MAGA morons had the easy ability to fabricate whatever video evidence they wanted of election fraud? They just might by the time 2024 rolls around.

Political and social rivalries can already be easily manipulated. Now add the ability to create a video of anyone doing anything in the context of sparking social unrest.

Warring nations can fabricate the same, inflame the public to garner support for invasion/genocide (this might already be the case in the Middle East).

Video and photographic evidence will become useless in a court of law as AI will become capable of creating anything in any context needed.

THIS is what terrifies me. We've already learned over the last few years that Humanity is easily grifted and duped into literal violence over videos taken out of context, or just flat out lies that play to their fears. It doesn't even have to make sense sometimes.

Where before, only boomers were really fooled by photo shops of still images. But if you saw a moving video with audio, it was reasonable to consider it authentic.

What happens to humanity when no picture, video or audio of anything can be authenticated?  And how many conflicts, scandals, distractions and upheavals happen before humanity learns the hard lesson that nothing in the digital realm can be considered real anymore?

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Yup. And when I watch our elected officials attempt to ask questions of these tech bros, it’s painfully clear that they have absolutely no idea what they’re even attempting to discuss, much less erect useful guardrails. We’re doomed."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I am in IT.  I am hoping to retire before my job is taken over by AI
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Conditionally. 

It's not really AI, it's just a very sophisticated algorithm that does some spectacularly stupid things. Human jobs aren't going to be substantially replaced for now. Be more worried about automation in general. If McDonald's isn't even a starter job wtf are people going to do? 

In terms of its ability to disrupt the global news cycle- I think the Internet is going to be less and less a source of trusted information. It does feel like it's going to be some kind of technological dark ages where powerful people control the horizontal and the vertical- until you realize it's always been this way, it's just more transparent than it's ever been. Which again- algorithms in general aren't the problem, it's the people using them and it's the same bad guys that have always been the bad guys."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"At work, if someone says their banking information has changed, we have to reach out to the account manager to make a phone call, or meet in person, with a trusted contact to confirm it.  There is no way to do so online and bank change scams are the norm, not the exception.

As unpopular as it is on reddit, I have increasingly decreased my social media time and reverted back to watching the news on TV.  They aren't perfect, but they do check into stuff and, if they are wrong, publish a correction.  Not perfect but better than trying to figure out what is true or false on X.

Two examples come to mind:

Shortly after the start of the war in Ukraine, Putin showed up at an Easter service.  People online couldn't tell if it was him or a computer generated image.  There was an Associated Press photographer who was at the church and verified that it was actually him.

When Kobe Bryant died, I received a news alert from a newspaper I trust.  When I saw the alert, I knew he was dead.  When I went into work the next day the younger people, who don't interact with the mainstream news, said they spent all day trying to figure out if it was true."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"No sure but remember this: We humans suck at predicting the future. A lot.

By the 90s we were supposed to have flying cars and trips to Mars, etc. based on 1950's predictions."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I’m in the field and I’m concerned about the surveillance and social engineering potential of AI. IMO you need to pay more attention at who is AND at who is not developing AI.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Also young Gen-X in the high-tech field here. My hope is that standards are eventually put in place with strict regulations for AI use. Think along the lines of IEC/ANSI. I can think of a few ways AI code can be frozen, signed  encrypted, etc. so that it only runs on well regulated and authorized platforms. AI is uncharted territory, but I have hope our existing standards can be applied to this technology."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?si=o0Nbaf7doVIgA6ak

This still terrifies me, and it’s 9 years old now."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I’m concerned about the loss of information value and credibility of information. We already saw how willing some segments are to just blindly believe shit because it was online. Now it will be based on actual language models that can sound like an adult, and change to different lingo styles. I can talk to my kid by asking chatGPT to covert stuff to GenZ and vice versa, and it works. Photos are quickly changing from “a photo is worth 1000 words” to “a photo can be a big lie”

TLDR: information will no longer be credible unless it is directly observed or comes from a trusted vetting source."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Not worried about it at all. Whatever is going to happen is something I have no control over. 

The fact is that a number of well placed EMP weapons could send us back to the 1950s in the blink of an eye. A nutjob with nuclear codes can ensure that most of humanity and the progress it's made can be wiped out in under an hour. 

Worried about AI? Yeah, whatever. It's not that I believe it to be an illegitimate threat, but it has competitors that have been around much longer and are just as likely candidates to ruin us."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"No, not worried about that. AI isn’t actual “intelligence” , it’s just an aggregator. Once people realize it’s being manipulated, they’ll start doubting it just like with fake news. It might actually do us all some good to be less gullible"
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I’m really worried. I try to balance my thoughts about the future and emerging technologies but then I remember my fellow human beings’ capacity for hate and deception. Guhhhhh.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,Chat GPT is the grandfather of SkyNet
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I used to work as a full-time blacksmith doing historical restoration and reproduction. There will always be things for us to do, and even anachronisms have their place.

Am I worried? Not about the technology itself, but more about people freaking out over it. The sky is not falling any more than it did when Covid exposed the flaws in our workplace models. AI is just another development that shows us what we already knew but didn't necessarily fully appreciate: humans and their desires are more predictable at large scale than that are at small scale, and broader technologies tend to amplify the power of the powerful. With time, AI may fade into the background like other revolutionary media technologies such as radio, television, smartphones, and telecommunications satellites.

If it goes really bad, my opinion is that it will be a downstream result of AI applications to bioweapons development or nuclear controls, which are big problems already without a connection to AI."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I’m a voice actor and this is a big worry in our industry, but consumers do not respond favorably to robot voices..if you have a Bot narrate a script or book or whatever, you are seen as a cheapskate.  

People still crave human story telling, I am sure this is applicable in writing, and other forms or arts.  

AI is largely received as the Dollar General edition of entertainment..viewers and listeners still crave a loved human experience and AI cannot duplicate that in art."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,There will be a need for an IT job of AI forensics where an IT professional will determine the validity of digital works. We will also see AI help in matters of law and medicine and new jobs will open up there.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I work in IT too.  AI, like most tech, will only make our lives easier.  As we get older, we are going to really appreciate the impact AI will make on medical diagnosis and the like.  Thinking AI is only going to bring bad things is like saying the internet sucks because of social media."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Definitely, I fear it'll be our downfall"

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"There’s a great [Behind the Bastards episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/behind-the-bastards/id1373812661?i=1000617646703) about how AI generated children’s & adult books are becoming a big,bad thing on Amazon.

Our brains aren’t evolved enough to handle what’s next—and that’s just as true for those who grew up online. If I decide not to age for the long haul,it won’t be due to physical problems,it’ll be because of 21st century dystopia."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"There will be lawsuits coming and I think that any AI that has been trained using content with a copyright will be forced to retrain without it.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"IMHO, we need to strictly regulate AI. 

I believe real jobs will be lost for false written text/art. AI works that will not hold up to actual human work.

I believe real elections will be compromised with only a few days to go before elections with fraudulent videos/pics. 

I believe the impact to our businesses could have monumental decisions on labor, workforce and discriminatory practices in hiring/firing/serving customers. 

Until we can see a full proof of concept addressing real world concerns about plagiarism and creative theft, workforce reductions and built in identifiers for AI videos/pictures/etc..., I dont believe AI should be allowed in the full public market at this time."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"When no picture, video or audio can be authenticated then we live in a nihilistic society.

Trust will be eroded. People will start to rely only real life interactions. They may possibly choose to live a predominantly analog lifestyle. Communities will become more insular. Globalization, as we know it, will likely collapse.

Eventually,there will be a premium on truth and people will value people with strong moral character.

The pendulum will swing. I don’t know how fast, and I don’t know how ugly things will get between now and then.

Content is not art. Content is empty calories, the high fructose corn syrup of the soul. Content serves the corporations. People eventually rebel against every institution, they will eventually rebel against corporations. This country was anti-trust and anti-monopoly once, it must have taken a heck of a lot of strong arming to wrest the power away from those small elite group and history does enjoy repeating itself.

But anyway, art is about humans, about communicating the human condition, about making meaningful connections. Once people have consumed so much content, most will be hungry for something real or too ill to participate in society.

We won’t invent skynet. The majority of people who are making it are far too selfish and corrupt. It’s just the crypto bros moving to fresh turf. I’ve worked with wannabe crypto bros, they don’t care about anything but getting rich. For them, AI is just a new way to figure out how to con people. They never say this to your face, but if you’ve heard them talk long enough it’s all bout the money.

AI will follow the enshittification business model. Make something really good, really cool, really fun and free or way under market value. Get people hooked, get the tech integrated into daily life, let everyone get comfortable then start pulling the money making levers. AI will become a mouthpiece for advertising, another way to get user data, a way to customize advertisements. It will become shitty to use but people will struggle to abandon it, even though they will have soured on it. Meanwhile AI will siphon more money off the advertisers.

Bot farms and other users of AI will start to get priced out of using it as much.

For all those companies that fired 50 writers, AI will charge what their salaries cost in a few years. One day some business people will say “we are making too much content, let’s make less and get more engagement. Then it will be “you know what? Let’s hire some scrappy college grads and pay them $30k a year. It’ll be cheaper than what we are paying for our AI.” Then they will advertise they have content made by real humans! And it will be novel and interesting! Then other companies will start doing the same. AI companies will start to lose revenue so they will enshittifiy further and eventually it will be outdated and some new version of things will come about.

No one needs to be a toll booth operator. No one needs to hand screw bottle caps onto bottles. No one needs to be a file clerk. All those jobs are not really feeding people’s souls. But when you start to try to replace people who think with some sterile tech…I just can’t see people accepting that.

They say teach a person to fish, they eat for a lifetime, build robots to sustainably catch and distribute all the fish… do you make people catch fish anyway? Do you make up fake work for them to do to earn their fish? Or do we let people move into arts, crafts and leisure? Do we let society advance with tech? Or do we refuse and get rid of the robots and go back to the days of old?"
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I work in tech and we have to use AI for some things and the biggest one to me is all the deep fakes. People have already shown how easily they can be manipulated by misinformation and it scares me what happens when these morons ""see it for themselves""."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"There are things generative AI can be (and hopefully will be) world changingly good at. For example, a lot of our professional services, including doctors, lawyers, medical professionals, mental health workers, financial advisors and so on will are inaccessible to large swaths of our population. Gen AI has the potential to exponentially scale the caseload that an individual practitioner can cover, lowering the cost of service and democratizing access to some form of it in ways that can’t be done today.

My fear of AI isn’t really about the AI, but about the idiots who will wield it. People are going to ascribe legitimacy to what it says even if it’s absolutely bogus. People are going to lean on it not because it’s good, but because it’s good enough for whatever they need it for in the moment. I’m afraid people will forget how to think critically, how to make decisions for themselves, or how to learn what they need to learn. I’m concerned about AI being used to power the idiocracy."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"AI video with AI sound is going to be a large issue in the US (and other) 2024 elections, no doubt of that.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I'm a youngish GenX and I don't worry about. I know I'm getting old though because it's the first time I have zero interest in a revolutionary tech after being super plugged in to everything my whole life. It overwhelms me so I'm out on this one. I know it will eventually (or quickly) be integrated into everything though.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Yeah I do worry. I am hopeful it is used for good but definitely can see it replacing some jobs, or as you mentioned used for bad things like deepfakes and such. I’ve seen videos where they can take someone like President Obama’s voice, I mean like 5 seconds of it, and then replicate it to say ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING!! That is scary. It’s part of what is holding up the SAG strike, actors and actresses are rightfully concerned that AI could replace them….and remember not everyone in Hollywood is a multimillionaire. Plenty of ham and eggers who don’t make that much could be replaced by AI. 

For me personally? I work in medical sales and don’t see AI taking my job….but who knows? 

I am hoping the government puts into place some very strict laws around its implementation but I’m not optimistic….and even then people will find ways around them."

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"This, OP! Totally agree with you. And I don’t know how to deal with it. The comments here allow me to think more about it and learn how to deal with it. Still terrified, though."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,Or will people even care if it’s real or not?
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Some aspects of it I definitely don’t like — the deep fakes and stuff like that creeps me out and makes me worry about people being easily manipulated, more than they already are. But as an artist and illustrator, AI art can only be generated from works that people have already done. I dabbled in midjourney and it produced interesting images, but a lot of it had the same generic look and feel of stock illustration (something else people thought would kill commercial art). Some of it is already used as design tools and it could be useful to help generate some visual ideas. But my belief is that people are still going to need human input and want handmade, human-made things. In a world of mass production, people can have those things on the cheap, but there’s still the desire for something artisan, be it coffee, beer, handbags, or art. I can’t speak of the implications of AI in other fields, though."

My lack of option to consent is not consent. I refuse to participate."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Yes, for various reasons, but the one that hits closest to home is when AI decides who gets an interview and not a real person. My husband has been looking for months, and he’s been rejected by AI many times."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"There's this entire concept of ethics in data/analytics/machine learning where you should be attempting to remove human bias that could result in discrimination from your models.

Not sure how that plays out when you're specifically using them to create ""fictional content.""

But it's an area that needs understanding. Regulation eventually - outside of standard anti discrimination/libel/slander/whatever standards fox news isn't held to because they're entertainment.

AI is a tool ... not inherently frightening, just different. But it helps to understand what it can be used for and to proactively set guideposts where needed. The issues are - how to set them when people making the rules don't know what it does or how? And how to enforce them when sometimes detecting/enforcing runs into gray areas? What's the difference between something purposeful and something just getting into a training loop (if that's the right word - and when is a training loop bad v. Being a desired result)?"
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"AI is going to take over most things.  Now tell me the timescale on which this happens.  Does it take 5 years? 50?  No one can tell.  There is no way to predict technological progress because we're inventing it as we go. Will AI turn out to be only useful for making fake news and cheesy art?  Will it replace all actors, artists, doctors, lawyers, etc?

It could, but who knows if it will.

Plenty of other things to worry about.  Some idiot in his garage can edit the DNA of living organisms now. I worry more about that. I worry about a generation of morons taking over my nuclear armed country. I worry about cancer and heart disease. I don't worry too much about AI.

I'm a programmer, and my job could theoretically be taken by AI, and it probably will be one day, but I don't actively worry about it."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"What baffles me is that every body is talking about AI but very few have even a concept of what AI is.  Many seem to think that a Photoshop deepfake is an example of AI.

Second, many fail to consider or realize the environment where programming decisions are made.  Most business and technical decisions are made in a conference room.  Have you ever witnessed the decision making that takes place in a conference room?

No, I am not overly concerned about AI.  The things that are going to fuck up AI have been fucking up software development and IT projects for decades.

I would recommend a good book on anti-patterns in the workplace and IT projects."

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I only lament that people like me will finally be obsolete when people like me and older retire.

I'm in my job because I can generate a cognizant email that directly caters to the addressees technical knowledge, location, and perfect tone to communicate bad news with my brain in seconds.  

I can search across legacy systems and use my eyeballs & brain trained from parsing data online since 1994 in every OS ever made nearly and find tiny codes, IDs, and use those systems to find things modern searching codes can't parse for or even see.

I work with roughly 300 people worldwide who can both find data, translate data, and spin data to address specific audiences using our brains, eyes, and neural nets alone.

Thing is they don't make us anymore. Temporally it's impossible to recreate 35+ years learning and evolving side by side with technology. Or people who've spent 20 years living a second life online.

No other generation will be born with our depth of mutual understanding and in the next 50 years sentient AI evolves, we will be it's midwives and mothers because we knew this child when it was just a whispered phrase in Basic on an Apple//.

There's no sign of them improving.

Oops they can't improve as they need humans to work them.

That's not going to change for a very long time.

If ever.

Computers can't think.

Humans are already doing a great job at that."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"No, not at all. I work with AI and have absolutely no concern about it. I do, however, have concern over its potential usage by bad actors. What I mean specifically isn't some mad scientist in his hidden lair or a state such as China or North Korea using it to destroy the world. What I most specifically mean is how an ethically bankrupt agency might use AI to gather personal information about people and exploit that information for profit, which is frankly the mostly likely impactful potential abuse of the tech at this point."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Not worried. It's an incredible technology that stands to change humanity to the same degree that the mobile Internet has.

I fully embrace these amazing new tools and also understand that those who do not will fall behind like all the businesses that failed to embrace the move to online commerce.

Maybe this will finally what gets us seriously rethinking how we approach capitalism. It doesn't seem like we can keep inventing jobs for people forever."

They believe what fits their narrative of the world.

At some point these AI ""artists"" will run out of dumb things to create and people won't care much anymore. We already have the ability to create special effects that fool most everyone. News stations cobble sound bites together to make it sound like people said things they didn't. It's not the technology that's the issue, it's that journalism no longer has any integrity.

It's a chat bot"
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"No, not at all. IMO, the current hype around AI is more designed to keep tech stocks looking sexy.

AI is based on previous human thought, and will always be dated and lack creativity.

The people that can be fooled by AI are the same people that can be fooled by content creators. There’s a good number of politicians that are little more than actors - think of all the preachy “pro-family‘ types with sex scandals.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I won't say that AI is definitely not going to doom us all.  However, in this current dumpster fire hellscape we find ourselves in, it's pretty low on the list.

If we were smart, we could use this to help us all have a much more leisurely life instead of killing ourselves working.  Of course, we're not smart."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Have you read Mo Gawdats ‘Scary Smart’? I’d highly recommend that. My thought is that when people think ‘AI’ and how it’s going to get us - is us at war with giant robot dogs and the like. What I think is most terrifying - is that it will be us at war with each other - through dis and misinformation - warping peoples perceptions and brains - disabling us from uniting against the real threats like climate change, viruses etc. It has already happened to a great extent - and I think we are all just the frogs in the pot - being suckered further and further into our devices. AI wins when our attention and focus has been robbed from us and we are in a hopeless depressive slump, disconnected from each other. That’s not how we’re supposed to live as human beings - I reflect often on the things that I learnt from Yuval Noah Harari’s ‘Sapiens’. We will be rendered fairly useless as a species unless people start to become aware of this and change their habits."

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"We'll see an increase in the importance of unfoolable certification of the origin of content.

So, because I know this isn't all that hard, I'm not ""low key terrified""."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I wasn't until the last election cycle.  In the U.S., at least half of the population is extremely gullible to falsified information from individuals in positions of power.  AI allows someone to basically create aerosolized, weaponized propaganda.  It's fast:  created fast and spreads fast.  Knowing how bad it will get is a bit terrifying.  There will be learning curves and regulations but it'll be messy for a while.  


I'm looking for an AI to start creating religiously targeted propaganda to shift political/societal norms and eventually create an entirely new religion 100% controlled by AI.  That sounds fun!."

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"You are right to be concerned. Our legislators are effing ancient, and can't even imagine what the tech is capable of doing, or how it could be used against them, both now and in the future.

At a low level, I am bemused that people are using AI to write resumes to fool the application systems and processes. Let the computers talk to each other, let's see how that works out for companies.

There's so much cyberwarfare already in play, and life for my kids has the potential to be dramatically different than what I've known. It's ""progress"", but at what cost?"

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,One of the potential use cases of blockchain is certifying authenticity of a digital asset. NFTs on their own is silly but maybe an image or video that isn’t doctored by AI can be authenticated as such and therefore trusted?
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,GenX and “low key” don’t typically go together.

It feels like a fantastic tool. I’ve never been artistically talented and now I can take the images in my head and transfer them to the world. 

I also have ChatGPT on the phone and it’s really good at answering questions and it has a lot more potential than that."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Not me. I’m excited as hell to see the potential. People were scared that installing electricity would end the world.. then they was scared that wireless technology would give us brain worms or whatever, then it was microwave ovens, then it was beepers.. etc. 
anything can be used maliciously. You could kill with a spork ffs. 
But AI will solve problems humans have struggled with forever. It will revolutionize humanity. This is going to be a huge as the invention of the internet."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,No. It’s just a new technology that will change the way we live and work. People are always afraid of new tech but inevitably we see more job innovation and growth with it.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Also, human memory is so fallible that, **every single time** we remember something, we change that memory slightly.  This was conclusively proven with people's memories of 9/11.  3,000 people were surveyed about their memories of 9/11, not long after it.  

Then, every 6 months, the same people were surveyed.  Ten years later, several hundred people were still participating.  Their answers **to the same questions** were profoundly different, but the people were totally convinced their memories of the day were accurate."

The question is, what are we going to DO about our worries?"
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I’m currently working on a report for a medical association on ai in healthcare.  It’s a little bit impressive and a lot terrifying.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I once tried my hand at stone carving. Man, I really liked it, but couldn’t find the time for it.

Think about that. You get a rock, some chisels, and start making something. Sure, your first attempts won’t be anything dazzling, but you have made something.

This idea of handmade things brings me peace, because something tangible exists and someone is connected to it.

I think our future is that. We often think we have no choice, no control and so many things are inevitable, but we do have choices. We don’t have to buy things that come from some faceless exploited worker just because it’s a bargain. We don’t have to have the latest tech. We must remember that. We do have the power, we just have to apply it in our daily lives.

I’m reminded of GDPR. How is it Europe has laws that allow one to maintain at least some control of their data whereas most US states don’t? Because they believe they can, and that humanity is worth more than a quarterly profit.

If AI obliterates the US, it’ll only be because people forgot they could put on the brakes. That they could hold AI companies (and robotics companies, like Boston Dynamics) accountable. We can also stop buying into the idea that all new tech is a good thing for everyone or even solves useful problems. Some things can’t be solved by tech.

Try your hand at an art. It really helps with stress. Also, look for ways you can make a difference. Support businesses you know and believe in whenever you can."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I’m a ‘72 model GenX, and I also worked IT/IS for a while (three decades). I’m still a bleeding edge guy when it comes to technology, but I’ve already been impacted by AI in a negative manner.  

After I burnt out in IT/IS, I started doing DJ and voice production work with my brother.  The DJ gigs still pay, but I can’t get voiceover work anymore.  AI voiceover, even to the point of AI writing the copy before doing the voiceover.  Radio Stations literally have thousands of ‘news jockeys’ at their disposal now."

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"from photography background... the broad consequences of AI are going to be bad.    I'll admit, I proved to myself my ability long ago, so the 'rush' came from sharing and feedback etc.  That is now entirely destroyed as the 'value' of the image has plummeted to almost nothing.  It became clear after driving 300km and spending a day to get a perfect shot, only to have people ask what app or photoshop techniques I used.... Ai is taking that another level again.     People who derive joy form the arts as a stricltly personal pleasure will continue to thrive, but anyone who thrives on the engagement form their art... is in for big disappointment, be it in literature, or visual arts.

again, using that industry which I have come to view as the canary in the coal mine (also first hugely impacted by the digital age).   The thing most people miss is that large numbers of people made a living from stock photography, catalogues, poster work, product shots, etc etc etc.  really really mundane stuff, but it was the bread and butter that fed the business and enabled the creative.   This is now going to happen across countless industries.

I have no issue with AI... and embrace it, but how we setup society and the way we are engaging with it will wreak havoc, and some argue already is. (movies? journalism?).

I also have an IMMENSE issue with any censorship or tweaking of ai to give... a preferred answer. They have already gone way over the top where innocent questions can result in a response claiming it won't answer as it's inappropriate.  Being on the other side of the planet I am apparently subject to US prudishness... thanks for that.  Then there is the political and ideology aspects, as well as the fact it is being used globally and those issues are NOT dealt with the same way in many other countries.  ie there is a heavy inbuilt bias, first and foremost to the American perspective, and secondly the western anglo perspective.      Either AI is free to do it's thing or it's useless imho.   Indeed this initial release seems to be getting pretty hamstrung by this exact issue.. sometimes spitting out rubbish answers but due to the current AI architecture it's almost impossible to see the decision tree that it used to formulate that answer. There is talk of having to attack it from a different angle and build it again.. from the ground up 

full AI drones and weapons.. THAT is a bigger concern, and if you haven't looked into it I heavily suggest you read up on [The Red Button Problem](https://youtu.be/3TYT1QfdfsM?si=jIbncGXanxKQmY3l).  Military simulations have already shown it will take out the red button if it thinks it will prevent it from achieving it's objective and if that is made impossible, it will go for the comms"
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Yes, not even low key, absolutely terrified. It does not bode well for humanity at all. I think that's why we see more really smart people bowing out now. Technology is advancing at such an incredible pace, there's no way for our laws, systems and institutions to keep up.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I think an interesting idea that came to mind while reading this is that humans are always growing. There are rhythms and patterns to what we create, but there always seems to be new forms of expressing it or creating. In the midst of all that, AI relies on what it has to use to make what it could perceive. To me, that puts it at a limit even if it creates new variables."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Nope, I'm excited!  I might have to re-train in a decade or somehow my job (which I'm studying for and will soon be training for) will evolve.  I surprise myself with my optimism regarding this."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I just saw something talking about how dangerous AI could be in everyday stuff. To make his point, he talked about how using AI for revenge porn is. The guy said he used an AI generated picture of a girl wearing normal clothes: A bit of midriff showing, tank top, cute jeans. AI came up with the same picture but with her naked. He blurred it out, of course. But it’s easily possible. 

I’m a young gen Xer, myself. AI is pretty fucking scary. I’ve thought about the use of it for political purposes as well. And Congress doesn’t seem too concerned with regulating it at this point. We’re doomed."

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"TL;DR: No, and sorry to ramble had limited time to edit and some is talktotext.

More concerned about 2 other things:

1) That in the US people will reject and dismiss AI out of hand because of the *perception* of its alleged problems -- problems that, if they can be imagined, they are already being mitigated -- and that as a result, bad actors will get an edge when it comes to innovation and adoption. AI is not new; you've already seen it and even adopted and accepted it for over a decade. The thing that is sort of ""new-ish"" and grabbing attention now are products of *generative* AI and the like. Our standard of proof of something being ""real"" has never been ""Omg, how do we prove this *isn't* real?!"" it's been ""How do we prove that this IS real?"" The products of generative AI have all sorts of markers all over them; sure they may need to go under a proverbial microscope to be seen readily, but they're still easy to find once you're looking for them. If you are really worried that you won't know what's actually going on, *stop entertaining yourself to death* and just monitor CSPAN and CCTV footage live to hear whatever blather straight from the horses' mouths, OR just find the sources that do -- i.e. real journalists and transcripts. Seriously, nothing about real news or geopolitics is supposed to be titillating or entertaining; if your source is, it's being done all wrong. 

2) That our current economic reality will dictate who will own and benefit from what we end up using the most for years to come. In the middle of this HUGE explosion of innovation, gosh, we just happen to all need to tighten our belts! That means new AI startups are already having a hard time getting funding, and the ones that established in the last few years are being snapped up for ""cheap"" by Apples, Googles, Metas, Microsofts and all the other usual suspects. 

On a totally separate note: One of the funniest damn things I read recently was how ""the hottest new programming language is... English"". So much for the ""STEM iS tHe oNLy WaY tO gEt A joB"" theories pushed for the last 30 years. *Critical thinking* in IT is going to beat out all the specialization in the years to come and I can't fucking wait 🍿 in fact just stop sending your kids into IT fields and send them where they're really needed: fucking civics class, law school, med school, nursing school... those shortages and backlogs CANNOT be fixed by more tech, only by more qualified PEOPLE."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Not at all.

They like to pretend AI is all-powerful but in truth it's more like RoboCop.  Computers are incredibly bad at things in the real world.  The writing and art are so incredibly bad if you actually look at it.  Extra arms.  Complete misunderstanding of common items.  We are not close to fixing this. 

The AI doing this isn't even completely understood so it's hard to fix these issues. 

We used to not have cameras everyplace.  Worse case we have to live in a world where we ignore the evidence from these cameras as if they were not there."

I have no doubt AI is going to change everything. Kinda like the internet did. Differently, but at a similar scale. 

Surf the wave or drown. It’s going to get wild."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Well, it is idiotic to embrace tyranny. The most cursory glance at history tells us this. 

The Democrats are trying to maintain democracy at least. At least they have identifiable policy positions designed to improve the lives of Americans. What does the GOP have? As far as can be ascertained, and according to what their platform was during the 2020 election, their policy consists of whatever that bloated conman shits out of his mouth at any given moment. Well, they're also automatically against whatever Democrats are for. So there's that."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,Weird flex? Was I supposed to say ANTIFA somewhere to balance it out for you? Interesting you immediately take MAGA as republicans though.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,“Idiocracy” has morphed from satire to guidebook.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,Agreed. And our lawmakers are clueless about tech and thus wouldn’t know what guardrails to even propose.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Yup, just like elected officials “knowing” what’s best for healthcare and education."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Developer here with two decades of experience.

AI isn't anywhere near being able to replace experienced devs....the problem is that with AI people who are experienced are far more efficient, making there less of a need for extra help, so less room for entry level devs.

And those who aren't experienced are burning themselves if they overly rely on it.

It's an interesting conundrum."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I am using GitHub Co-pilot as I write code. It is helpful and will make developers better and faster.  However, currently, it can't design the software, architecture, manage versioning. It can't package it up into deployable software. I can gaurantee the non developers I work with in IT and our business partners will not be using AI to build software anytime soon. AI will be another tool in the toolbox much like google has been for a long time but just smarter."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Isn't it funny that the people who truly understand what the latest ""AI"" can and can't do are down voted by the lemmings who need to hear more to fear?

You're right. This isn't AI. This is a typical relevance copy paste bot."

It has flying cars.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,This concerns me more than a lot of apocalyptic scenarios. A sufficiently sized EMP will wipe out ALL electronics as well as the transformers in the power grid. We'd be thrown back into the 19th century in the blink of an eye.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I think you listen to too many podcasts
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I think we're already passed that. I think idiocracy is a bar that is now too high to reach.
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"That’s what I mean they wouldn’t specifically propose them. They will have to lay that in the lap of the software developers and  tell them, you cannot release your products without proper safeguards and then have them go before Congress to explain what safe guards they have in place before allowing them to release their software. 
I don’t want the politicians telling me what they want because they don’t know enough to speak on the potentials. I want engineers to tell us, here’s how we can safeguard people. All I need the politicians to do is make those engineers jump through those hoops."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I think you are underestimating the wealthy's desire to replace all humans with things with no rights.

I'm sure you are correct. IDK about code, but AI articles are terrible because they cannot write decent intros. Intros require creativity, not rehashing, and all Chat GPT is right now is a plagarism bot. I don't know that AI can ever create something new, but I believe people will just stop using creative intros and just start vomiting information.

I think a lot of things are going to be like that (IDK about coding). It's like when the credit card machine goes down. In the past, they used those carbon copy things. Now they just say we can't accept them and move on.

I think media and business will reshape itself around AI, rather than try and get AI to shape itself around humanity. That's what happened with social media and the internet to a great extent. It took about 20 years. 

There has never been a more important time for workers to unite and demand our rights be safeguarded."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"This. AI can only could about 50% as well as Stack Overflow posts and relies on humans talking about coding to provide what it does. It also really sucks at asking questions to refine the ask. It will change things, but it’s not going to put us out of work."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Picking nits here, but it IS AI. AI has been on the lookout for fraudulent charges on your credit card for decades, but it's not as sensational or scary as AI that can pass the turing test.

To your point it isn't Artificial General Intelligence, it doesn't think the way you or I do. It's more like thinking the way a housefly does, within very tight limits.instead of seeking food, mating and survival, chatgpt seeks words that make sense in response to a prompt."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Yet... We didn't get our cyberpunk dystopian society yet.

Most cyberpunk media has ai in it."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Uh, look around; we *absolutely* have a cyberpunk dystopia

About the only detail that *didn't* happen is superficial; most of our gadgets are disposable instead of implanted. (Which in hindsight is even *more* cyberpunk dystopian than what OG cyberpunk described)"

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"True, sadly."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,I don’t like this take. Engineers will happily erect meaningless hoops and jump through them.  We need someone looking out for people over dollars who can effectively point out where the barriers belong.

GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"Self driving cars... FULLY self driving cars are a LONG way off.

The amazing progress we've seen are the easy parts. Rain, snow, fog, flooded out roads, etc... This is where things get super hard."
GenX,Anyone else low key terrified of AI's impact on humanity in the next decade?,"I have met politicians. I’ve also met corporate executives.  Can’t say I’m especially impressed with either.  Nevertheless, we definitely don’t want corporations left alone to make whatever ai decisions they like and not having tech savvy regulators effectively means no regulation on training parameters, regression assumptions, training data, and everything under the hood. I don’t want just a responsive user interface, I want fundamentally sound deep learning."
