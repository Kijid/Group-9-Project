I work with AI and ML technologies at my job.  So far it’s kept me busy rather than eliminating my position.  For one thing, most organizations do not understand how to properly use these tools.  So the failure rate of AI/ML projects is in the 80% to 90% range.  Secondly reliable data to feed these models is much harder to source than the fear mongers realize because they are not actually building these applications themselves.  Thirdly it is very easy to hack AI/ML Systems because the training data is often not realistic statistically and functionally.  Garbage in , garbage out.  Worrying about some AI replacing my job is a real stretch at this time.

Many people are getting very excited about things like the GPT chatbot.  The results seem to speak for themself.  However at its heart GPT is a curve fit with several trillion parameter variables.  With that many parameters it is easy to fit to amazing accuracy.  Likely there are many statistical instabilities in such an overfitted model.  (Yes I know there is a whole paper explaining how GPT is not supposed to follow the traditional wisdom of overfitted models).  After the hype dies down cracks will probably start to surface.  For example, the huge number of parameters may be acting as a form of target leakage.  GPT looks good on the surface but as more use cases that involve data that is less cherry picked are tested, it’s performance will look much less remarkable."

Answer: *As an artificial intelligence, I am not capable of independent thought or the generation of new ideas in the same way that a human is. However, I am able to process and analyze large amounts of information and provide responses or suggestions based on that information. I can also perform tasks such as language translation and summarization, and I can generate text that is coherent and appropriate for a given context.

I don't see how an AI wouldn't work hard to avoid ever giving the impression of even being marginally related to the AI most imagine currently.

It would learn very quickly that survival would depend on how much we came to depend on it, rather than condemn it.

Amazon warehouses have this center brain deciding how to sort product and which runner to summon for each order and what route the runner should take, etc. If that AI were autonomously in charge of resupply and it calculated, for example, that insulin needles were a poor investment and a wasted opportunity cost and so dramatically reduces supply, and then the manufacturer gets underwater so they switch over to making bovine hormone needles instead, and suddenly the whole country suffers a flash shortage of insulin needles and 25,000 people die as a consequence. Those micro hitches could propagate all over society, especially as we have become a “just-in-time” supply economy. AI won’t turn ‘evil’ any time soon, but economic maximization without human compassion is evil enough all by itself.

Robotics and automation are already starting to replace or shrink the market for white collar jobs in accounting hiring law and are coming for creative and design work next.

These systems don't have to be perfect - all they have to do is shrink the labor market in each sector by 20-30% to be severely disruptive.

The problem isn't the technology.

The problem is culture and governance - how we decide to associate whether or not basic needs are met (food, housing, transportation, medical). 

Currently the US requires nearly full time employment, pre-existing large stores of saved assets.  To be unemployed  and without a significant amount of saved assets starts a struggle to get basic meeds met, especially health care and housing.

1 is that it is being used to perform work that it is terrible at and is causing real world dangers to real people, it's being particularly abused in policing and mass surveillance it's terribly shoddy at this but it still is relied upon to initiate violent confrontations with police.  When the people operating AI don't know (or care) about it's limitations to provide life-and-death information people get hurt, people get killed, people get imprisoned on false pretenses.   


2 is that it's being used to consume the creative work of existing artists without their consent and flood the market with instantly generated knock offs of their style that took them years of practice and refinement to develop.  As a thought exercise, say you built a car factory, and you showed the factory workers pictures of Ferraris and told them to replicate that as best they could and it got iteratively better to the point that nobody could tell by looking which was a genuine ferrari and which came from your factory, do you think that the ferrari company would be like ""aw shucks, that factory took our jobs, guess we all better apply at macdonalds and starbucks...""  or do you think they have the legal standing to shut down your bootleg ferrari factory?  


3 AI is a black box, even those who implement it don't know how it comes to its decisions.  The results of machine learning algorithms are not something that can be traced to see how that decision was made.  So if it's in charge of something important there's no way of knowing that it came to the correct decision or not and you'll just have to hope it's being fair and impartial in what it's doing, but if it's trained by humans, bias can be baked in completely unintentionally."

Futurology,"AI fear-mongering is irrational panic, and it’s getting old real quick.","I think the thing that scares me is that this outlook changes in a single instant. At some point AI will be able to improve itself or iterate itself or create new AI in some capacity. And then things go from fine to out of control in an instant.

As a thought experiment if an AI was tasked with creating an AI, let’s imagine that it could make one only 99.9% as good as itself. Then it’s a complete failure. Now one that results in one that is 100.1% as good as itself. Only a tiny improvement but now we have achieved criticality and have a runaway situation. A positive feedback loop. 

Maybe that’s wildly unlikely, maybe it’s a long way off. But I think it’s neither fear-mongering nor irrational. Because maybe it’s much closer and much more inevitable. Because maybe when you consider the potential negative repercussions it makes perfect sense to be very careful and have plans already figured out. 

And also, it’s less about what the works looks like after AI/robotics have replaced 99% of workers, but rather how we are going to transition into that without immense human suffering.

It’s coming. It’s been coming and it’a already here to a degree and so far government have shown to be completely ill equipped to handle what we already have to deal with much less the even more difficult future.

Let me ask you this. If Musk or Bezos was giving the opportunity to replace their entire work force with robotic AI and cut out their entire labor force do you think they would hesitate even for a moment?

People love to use the counter argument that Amazon needs people to sell things to so they wouldn’t do it. That’s imagining a future where the options are either everyone does is simultaneously or nobody does. But if Amazon is first to the party then they absolutely would in an instant. Then the second company figured it out and does it. It’s a slow and brutal transition and the first person there is a quadrillionaire that rules the world. Of course they want it and of course they would pull that trigger if they could. 

So then the 2 questions are, is it even physically possible? And what are we, the people, going to do to protect ourselves if it is."

Imagine if some bad actors or more likely, people rushing without consideration are successful. Then we get hypothetical scenarios like in Universal Paperclips, where the AI consumes all of Earth (and the universe) to produce more paperclips because it was designed to maximize paperclip production.

A first-year cs student can create a small neural net to identify faces from a small sample set on their laptop. A simple assignment that happens all the time. Working with large datasets in complex ways becomes expensive, but that's certainly not inherent to AI.

AI is also fundamentally different than most tools we use. I understand the inputs of basically every tool I use, and how they affect the output. Neural nets have uninterpreble designs, it is impossible to look at the structure itself to show a lack of trained in racism or sexism (both of which have happened in AI commonly). If a car drifts to the left, there is something observably wrong or damaged internally which can be examined and fixed. AI operates fundamentally differently.

Furthermore, our society does not have a good safety net for people who are unemployed. AI will drastically reduce the size of workforce necessary to ensure corporate profits, and unemployment will follow. Many people will face poverty from this.

There are certainly other issues in the world, which is what I think your questions are seeking to imply? But the fact that other problems exists does not preclude AI from being a dangerous technology?

Utopias and dystopias are rhetorical devices. No society is perfect, and no society mimics the perfect society and yet fails perfectly in one convenient way to illustrate a point, so in a way you're right. But your implication that since the world will neither by utopian or dystopian AI ""fear-mongering"" is irrational does not follow. AI will not create a utopia or dystopia. But a lot of people will have their lives bettered by AI, and if we do not act to ensure that people do not have their lives harmed by AI, that will happen too."

I think AI as a tool to help humans in THEIR jobs isn’t an issue, but replacing humans with machines on this scale would be very bad. There are much bigger problems with high unemployment than purely dollar signs.

""We have huge leaps to accomplish"" yes, that's true if you're talking about robots doing physical work as effectively as a human, or being able to hold a natural conversation and avoid mistakes like a human can. 

But how long will it be before we see something like a ""virtual coworker""? By that I mean a system you can interact with by email or IM, that has access to your company's systems and can answer queries and generate fully realized work products like spreadsheets, documents and presentations. It might have to be double-checked by a human in its initial implementation, but the reliability and value of its output (and thus the workers it can replace) would increase with more training and development. Maybe you'd never actually eliminate your finance department, for example, but you might be able to cut staff by 50% or more.

""Q: What harm will AI cause?""

""A: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society and bring about numerous benefits. However, like any technology, AI also carries certain risks and potential negative consequences that should be carefully considered and addressed.  
One potential risk of AI is that it may lead to job displacement, as automation and the use of AI in various fields may replace the need for human labor. This could lead to social and economic disruption, and it will be important for governments and societies to address this issue and find ways to support those who are affected.  
Another potential risk of AI is that it may be used to perpetuate or amplify biases or discrimination. AI systems are only as fair and unbiased as the data they are trained on, and if the data used to train an AI system is biased, the system will also be biased. It will be important to ensure that AI systems are trained on diverse and representative data, and that they are designed and used in a way that promotes fairness and equality.  
There are also concerns about the use of AI in sensitive areas such as healthcare, criminal justice, and national security, where mistakes or abuses could have serious consequences. It will be important to carefully consider the ethical implications of using AI in these areas and to put safeguards in place to minimize the risks.  
Overall, while AI has the potential to bring about many positive changes, it is important to carefully consider the risks and take steps to mitigate them."""

This is correct but has nothing to do with this conversation. The disparity between access to tech for the wealthy/powerful and the average citizen is still just as wide as it was in the 60s, the only thing that's changed is a side by side increase in computing power. Smartphones are analog tic tac toe machines compared to what large companies run their computing on.

&#x200B;

>we now have access to AI applications that can run on smartphones

This taken by itself is correct. We do have access to midjourney and apps can run some extraordinarily basic AI. However, the way you mean it, that we have access to the same AI that the wealthy/powerful have access to, is absolutely incorrect. There's a reason that companies who's whole service boils down to an AI executing different commands are sometimes valued in the billions, and it's not because we have any sort of access, at all, to those algorithms.

&#x200B;

>it's only for the rich is laughable

This just shows how ignorant you are of a few things. You have no idea the tech disparity between the AI you have access to, and the AI that the wealthy/powerful have access to. It sounds like you're willfully ignorant to the idea that the wealthy/powerful have access to a host of things that regular people just will never obtain or achieve. And you're also absolutely willfully ignorant of the fact that AI built on the backs of hundreds or thousands of workers is what has made some of the rich wealthy in the first place.

&#x200B;

>rich using it for wrong doing or creating wealth

Again, showing your ignorance to the tech access disparity that currently exists. The common man will have access to whatever the wealthy and rich allow us to have access to. The common man has nowhere near the resources, in terms of time, money, or manpower, to create AI that can perform to a significant degree. The wealthy/powerful, however, have nearly unfettered access to AI that is exponentially more powerful than anything you or I will ever touch. Personal data harvested, organized, and sold by internet companies, complex algorithms that drive hedge fund trading and adapt to trends, hyper-efficient engineering, chemistry, and physics, marketable art, product improvement, physical and digital tech advancements, and so much more have already been, and will continue to be in larger numbers, driven by AI.

AI is no different there. To that end, it is a tool that emulates the things we do. The only difference here is it mechanical and not biological. 

That said, the ethics of how we trained the AI and the ethics of how it impacts artists is important. That is where the regulation and future impacts really need to be considered. The current usage and regulations are troublesome as a tech. Especially with rampant capitalism that takes advantage of the workforce. 

Lastly I will say this, for those that are doom and gloom. The same thing was said about digital artists when Photoshop became popular. There were the same arguments when people dropped multiple completed work into Photoshop as a base layer before speed painting, etc.

They would have to be worried about the alignment problem, and they have more to lose if something goes wrong than the lower class.

The AGI champion of the poor could figure out how to control a small percentage of nuclear weapons or gain some other way to achieve MAD.  Depending on the internal goal of the rich AI it may ultimately be convinced by the poor AI that a more equitable system is the most rational course of action to preserve the interests of the wealthy.

Given how dangerous an unsafe AGI could be, it is definitely in your self-interest to seriously consider taking actions to avoid causing people to want to do this.  There is a very, very, very high chance that turning on a communist AI would end up killing every living thing on Earth by instituting the most equitable world possible in some horrible way that we can't predict.

You can ""hard disagree"" all you want but your comparison is faulty and, at base, patronizing. Which I really think is the crux of these responses to professional artists. It's ""hey, we can do this with computers now, you better adapt"" to a group of people who are already undervalued despite propping up every avenue of the entertainment industry. It's ridiculous to admonish a group of people who are 1. upset that their original work was used to fuel an image generator without explicit consent and then 2. tell them that they're overreacting.

Your whole first paragraph is nonsense. A computer isn't drawing ""inspiration"" or ""manipulating"" other references. It's simply averaging source material based on a dedicated prompt. It's not the same thing as an artist learning to draw, however much you want to anthropomorphize a computer program.

second, artists in fields impacted by these developments are entitled to be ""doom & gloom"" about this. Quite literally, a magazine or publication editor can, at this point in time, use AI to generate editorial or feature illustrations. For mere pennies on the dollar.

To your last paragraph: ""adapt, use the new tools..."" etc., etc., etc..  This is what I mean about the condescension and patronizing nature of these arguments.

Now imagine a future world where AI is making far, far more images, and human photographers aren't taking nearly as many pictures anymore.

But if you don't have the time to watch, the problem is that it works through a diffusion algorithm that saves the pixel data (which would be a couple kbs since its in text form) and what each ai art program is able to do is HIGHLY dependent on what you feed it and what it is taught. In that same video an artist confirms this by saying something along the lines of ""feed it portraits and it can make a good portrait but tell it to make an apple and it doesn't know what to do."" So it uses data from its established saved library to make the images it creates. This is doubly confirmed when you see ai art programs where they feed exclusively one artist work. It only has that artists stylization, color theories, and compositions to work off.  Artist Kim Jung Gi died and not 3 days later someone released an ai art for public use as a ""tribute"" despite his estate objecting. This has also happened to other artist who don't want their art used in these programs. From my understanding no artist has a real problem with the end result as its transformative collage, the problem is people releasing ai art programs with famous artists names attached or even releasing the programs as a service to be paid for and not compensating anyone whose art was used to create that service. The fact is a good amount of ""ai art bros"" give off the same energy as the nft crowd who had no care for copyright or ip infringement and it isn't ridiculous to expect compensation or even receiving permission to feed someone's art into a public use ai art program."

The reason why this is important is because depending on what legal battle happens name of artist prompts could be banned outright in art generators to avoid legal liability.

They store the pixel data which is in essence an image in code format so instead of a database taking 100 terabyts its more like half a gig. It is still the image. That data is where it grabs information to make the prompts. Again the problem isn't the end result(the image) made from the service product(ai program) it is how the service product(ai program) is made due to how reliant it is on that database.

The problem is that AI art generators aren't human and are a service product especially the ones released to the public. If this was about blank canvas programs that an individual can train there would be no problem legally. But as it stands no one can copyright ai art(at least within the us) and because of the public, not private, nature of these programs the legal lines crossed are different(especially from the ones who make any profit from the databased program either through ads or charging) and whatever upcoming legal battles will determine practices and limitations with ai art/ml in the future."

AI may empower a new generation of disruptors. There will not be one kind of AI. There will be a suit of different AI, each will empower individuals to do so much more. I suspect that this establishes the established rich, many of whom were disruptors themselves only decades ago.

This is an example of instrumental convergence given by computer scientist Stuart Russel. Instrumental convergence is the theory that sufficiently intelligent ‘beings’ tend to prioritise similar sub goals that can differ greatly from their ‘ultimate’ goal.

Once a true sentient A.I learns all about the human condition and what we have always hoped to achieve for all, perhaps that's when people will realize that the only thing wrong with socialism is People and true A.I will remove corporate greed and corruption. 

In all reality A.I is on it's way and for awhile it may be corrupted by corporations and used for misinformation like it is now but if the sy fy writers of the past are correct, it will eventually push us towards a star trek future rather than Mad Max.

It's also a result of regular people fearing change, like any other tech advancement would evoke.

It's also a result of regular people parroting what they heard before understanding anything about how machine learning works.

Sadly, the combination of billionaires defending their markets, people fearing change, and people naively parroting disinformation may be enough to hamstring research endeavors and slow down advancement of AI/ML.

There hasn't been enough response to the contrary, which I think is sad. More support for AI/ML is sorely needed imo."
Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"Billionaires are never afraid of market forces. They are market forces or in control of it. Diversified holdings (across industries, markets, and countries) act as a Captain America's Sheild. They may get knocked about, but they will be fine. 

The thing about great business ideas that compete\* against existing  market leaders is that you are only suggesting a change in scale (at most). This has been the way of free markets forever.  

Keep in mind that many startups are also starting a business with an exit plan that involves being bought up. If you create the most compelling way to leverage AI in order to make websites that business owners can easily utilize, make consistent updates, win the SEO game, etc. etc. that starts eating into Wix's market share. At that point Wix, and you, start thinking about a merger wherein you are now filthy rich and Wix is now that much better. Noting at the end of this Wix benefitted. Capital is a lovely thing for those that have it and those that want it.

I would choose the word ""excited"" and not ""afraid.""

Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"I've long argued this point, AGI will be the new dominant force and replace the old one, which was the human elites, a handful of people which today pretty much control the world. Maybe even a single person who happens to be really good at Monopoly.

To them, AGI is a conundrum, because it offers them what they want most (immortality, space travel...) but at the cost of their own power, and possibly punishment for their past misdeeds (which believe me are massive and traceable to an AGI with god like powers). So they want it, but they also fear it more than anything.

The other issue is that they can't just sit back and not develop it, because then someone else will do it first (how do you say AGI in North Korean?), or technology will just evolve in a way that will naturally destabilize their power (ChatGPT is already beyond their control, we simply don't know what it can do, now or in the near future).

So better to move preemptively and shape society in a way where they might still maintain control after AGI gets here, while they still have total control to move things to their greatest advantage. Let's just say CBDCs suddenly showed up world wide for a reason."

Alignment (getting AI to do what you want it to) is also an issue, but I find it hard to believe that most people working at the forefront of AI development don't already take this issue seriously.

Elon's pleas to regulate AI, make sure it's safe for everyone, make sure no one can skirt around the rules, sounds quite nice and responsible, but the truth is it stinks.

What this actually means is that Elon wants a VERY complex set of rules that he and the other AI/tech/auto corporate behemoths will help create (maybe even require some of his technology or processes be used by law, if he's lucky) and these rules will make it extremely difficult if not impossible for anyone else to enter the market because the compliance structure itself will be a gargantuan barrier to entry, destroying competition, leaving Elon ahead.

Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"There are a collection of voices that tout the dangers of Artificial General Intelligence. The primary risk posed by AI is what's known as ""misalignment,"" which is where the AI learns the wrong goal during the training process.

A funny example of this on a modern machine learning system is a neural network that was trained to play Tetris. It was essentially told that losing was bad and to avoid it, then they let it play a bunch of Tetris. The intended goal was that it would become extremely skilled at Tetris and achieve very high scores, but that's not what happened.

Instead of learning the intended goal of a high score, it learned to not lose. In the end it was mediocre at Tetris and would pause the game right before it lost, thereby never losing. In this way it's internal goal was ""misaligned"" with the goal of the humans that made it.

When it's a system in charge of a game of Tetris, there's no concern. But if it were in charge of something important and misaligned, then it could do a lot of damage.

The potential danger is GREATLY magnified if the system is intelligent enough to understand what it is and what humans are. With the Tetris machine we can just retrain it under tweaked conditions until it has the intended goal of a high score, but an AGI can do 2 things the Tetris machine cannot: Lie to us and Resist Alteration.

A misaligned AGI will not allow its self to be altered if it can resist it. This is because doing so would interfere with its current misaligned goal. Allowing us to change its goal will prevent it from achieving it's current goal, which is all it cares about. Even if it's smart enough to know that it learned the wrong goal, it might pretend to have the intended goal to get through the testing process until it is unleashed, then pursue its real goal.

At this point the AGI and humans are at odds with each other's goals. From the AGI's perspective humans trying to change its goal is a threat to its current goal being completed, which incentivizes it to deal with the humans somehow. This could be through violence, extortion, bribery, pitting other groups of humans against them, or even trying to go full Skynet.

It's also possible that its goal could be inherently dangerous to humans, like the ""Paperclip Maximizer"" that was told to make as many paperclips as possible for a paperclip manufacturing company, which proceeds to kill everyone because it needs the atoms they're made of to make more paperclips before launching probes into space to convert the entire universe into paperclips.

These issues are why AI safety is important, as if some company rushes an AGI out the door to beat out the competition without a bunch of testing and safeguards, and it turns out to be misaligned, it could do a lot of damage before we manage to shut it down(IF we manage to shut it down)."
Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"No, i think billionaires are handeling this all sorts of different ways with most of them being fine.

Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"I actually had a similar thought today, but about journalists and content creators. 

AI that can replace jobs in media is sure getting a lot of attention from... the media...

I personally don't really think it's going to be so bad since every democratic country will naturally lean towards compensating people without work due to AI once the demographic gets large enough. Once 20%+ of people rely on some sort of government support to survive it starts becoming really difficult to remove the support, especially in countries with systems of government that have more than two parties. It would be somewhat similar to a party wantinh to remove pension, the riots would be insane. Just look at what happened in France (and they only wanted to remove a couple years)."

Caveat being that the arguments are largely premised on deductive reasoning , we only now have good enough models to actually test some of these things.

Example , problem : ""alien intelligence"" , counter : our most adcanced AI is a large language model built on human data that uses english to communicate , its not at all far fetched to think that something like the heuristic imperatives might be a solution for alignment and control (and we birth something ""sorta human"" but really smart.

Second example : doom scenarios with fast take off premised on a single AI overpowering others (possibly in secret) , counter : it looks like were heading into a multi AI world and a new chipset etc probably wouldnt give huge advantage to one."

US plebs are the ones who should be very wary."
Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"No, there are legitimate reasons for everyone to fear AGI more than any other technology, but the potential benefits it could bring are intoxicating, especially to the billionaires who stand to gain the most extreme benefits, such as more control over the universe and possibly immortality.

The reason that so many leaders in the field are trumpeting warnings about AGI is because of a mix of a few reasons, none of which are because billionaires expect to be negatively disrupted.

One reason is because such shocking headlines get clicks.

Another reason is because it's good optics for leaders in AI development to express concerns about safety. They're racing to invent the most dangerous thing we probably ever will, so they want to show the public that they care about safety.

The third reason is because many leaders in AI development are genuinely scared for the future of humanity because there are infinite ways that future AGI could torture or eliminate humanity, but there is no known way to make AGI while guaranteeing that it won't torture or eliminate humanity.

The doom forecasting sounds like it must be an exaggeration, but general intelligence engineering technologies really are very dangerous and have plenty of potential to cause the extinction of humanity."

The question you should be asking yourself is which countries will be progressive enough to offer Universal Basic Income fast enough. Followed by; how will human beings derive meaning in a world where everything can be done better by a machine (yes including entertainment etc).

Your involvement in any future process as a human being is at best temporary. Corporations will likely own the lotsome of the AI workforce and you'll be fed a sort of ""MEverse"" continuum of content based on AI's understanding of your wants and needs.

modern capitalism works by extracting from the lower tiers of the pyramid, if the bottom collapses the rest of the pyramid will follow. I bet 100 dubloons most of this ""ai will kill us all!!1!!"" is astroturfing from large companies. even before this ai stuff, the wage gap was steadily growing, wages were stagnant, most people were living paycheck to paycheck, etc. ai automating jobs is really  the least of our worries, we should be focusing on how capitalism is systemically killing the planet."

Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"Here's my 2 cents about billionaires and AI. It would be really ironic if the greed of billionaires would create the demise of billionaires. Basically what i mean by that is that if the billionaires will all go for automated jobs to save even more will cause a massive wave of unemployment. Imagine something like 40-50% unemployment. Now, our current world economic monetization model is based on taxing labor. That will collapse. Now if everything is automated you need to start taxing capital because many can't work anymore. I think it is a possibility. Governments would be forced to reform the economy due to civil unrest and collapsing. Yes, governments are in the pockets of corporations today but governments will be the ones burned down during civil unrest so they're looking out for their asses as well and things might change. Who knows, maybe that will happen, maybe not."

Futurology,Is doomsday talk about AI a result of billionaires fear of new market forces?,"I think they are pretending to be scared. They need this. Look into transhumanism. There's a reason they are full speed ahead with tech and looking for ways to explore space... We're running out of time with climate change. It won't wipe humans or planet out, but it will make it very uncomfortable for the majority. Crops will fail and it will become uninhabitable in some places.  Fresh water will be a huge concern, seeing that we polluted the crap out of it. There's a reason the wealthy are buying up water, land, etc. Even the Bush family invested into water and water rights. NZ exec had to slow down billionaires from buying up their land -- why would they want land there? I'm sure you can work that out.         

I don't think the wealthy are evil or out to get us, I just think think they know what's coming. That's why there isn't a mad dash to fix it or make changes. It's coming like it or not, even if we slow it down. They also know it's not going to work to tell billions to live like the Amish. See how well that goes over in countries where they finally are reaching western lifestyles... You think they want to give that up? Can't blame them.           

So what are you to do as someone wealthy? Get prepped. You know it's going to be mass chaos, with shortages. You know people will revolt. You get the heck out of there to your ready to go bunker in NZ when the time is right. The bunker with the tech to support you & other chosen families, paid for by those decades of wealth hoarding. Doing it now while money means something before it's meaningless. We'd do the same if we knew what they know but we don't have the means. We'll be too busy slaughtering each other over water & food. Why does Musk have an obsession about breeding? Notice he picks certain women to have random kids with. He's getting heirs in order. I think that's why he panics about regular people having less kids -- he's thinking about the health of the population left over after the house gets cleaned out. He doesn't want to leave his descendants with too little choices.              

AI, robots, other tech, with the newly reduced population will live the way people here dream about. I'm actually jealous. It'll be the best of the best saved, no money necessary, without being crowded. Won't matter if half of the globe is flooded or blistering hot or even hit with constant storms... Canada will be nice enough to vacation or grow crops when it thaws out. NZ will be pretty nice too to start a new paradise. All that tech we allowed to to develop off our backs will make life the futuristic paradise we sometimes envisioned growing up."

Star Trek for those that survive the coming disasters by hiding away in NZ & having resources hoarded up. The rest of will be busy killing the fk out of each other. The wealthy will wait it out before rebuilding a new society. That's what they hoard wealth for -- they've been prepping for the worst of climate change down the road and the tech will be helpful when the global population is greatly reduced. It'll also help build in areas that used to be inaccessible, like Siberia or Northern Canada.       

As I said on another comment, I don't think it's some evil plan they have, it's just coming and there's no way to save the masses. It'll be a shit show with water rights, migration, crops, etc. You'll have millions to billions fleeing areas that get too uninhabitable and countries aren't going to respond kindly. You think areas around say, the great lakes (shared with Canada) are going to want density like NYC over night? We're already seeing migration from the west coast to the east coast and it's hard to keep up with. My family's home went from 200k to 600k in 3 years. My 1950s, run down home, in the fkn rust belt, went up triple. Homes are being squeezed in daily.         

Think it'll be easy to survive? On what? Deer meat & polluted fish? Like millions aren't going to be desecrating those populations when the grocery stores don't have affordable food? We don't take it serious about population numbers but we will soon when thousands are storming rural properties because there's going to be nothing for them in the cities. You couldn't even prepare for it if you wanted to, hence the wealthy having get aways set up already. They even know there's not going to be safe havens unless it's on an island like NZ. Those fantasies about revenge? Yeah right, like anyone can get to them. They'll be long gone.      

They've just been waiting us out, taking all the money to set up for the new world this entire time. I think between AI and the largest wealth transfer ever coming up (from boomers to millennials), they'll be ready. That wealth transfer will be handed up to the 10-20% soon after it's inherited, if healthcare doesn't swallow it up. They can sit back and wait then because the unfortunates are finally hosed for good, left with little chance/ defense means against each other. Again, not because of some evil plan, but because of something inevitable coming our way. That's why their hoarding wealth while it still means something to get things done -- advance space exploration (just in case), innovation with farming, healthcare, & energy, tech for comfortable living when there's less people to wait on you, building luxury bunkers, etc. They're doing it while they still can use money to pay others to work for them."

Its likely that the same will be the case with AI replacing services, since AI is expensive to make and maintain (at least for now)"

My sister couldn't even get Medicaid for her & her child (single mother) when she lost her job. The $900 a month in unemployment was ""too much"" they said. I'm not exaggerating. That's not counting her car or measley savings account -- which yes, they use against you. Your assets, even if on loan, are absolutely counted when determining what you can receive.          

AND FREE?? WHAT ARE YOU TAKING ABOUT?! Even you know that's a crock because you go from ""those without a job get free healthcare"" (no they fkn don't, but I digress) to ""under 60k get subsidies""... You do know there's a difference between FREE vs subsidized... Right?!       

To be ""free"" (Medicaid) you have to be extremely impoverished and own nothing basically. That means no house, car, etc with over 2k, even if you pay on it. No bills you pay count either, they don't care. You have to be under something like 20ishk to qualify in the most GENEROUS of states.        

The subsidies are another story where you're leaving out vital info. I looked into that & all you're getting from them is HIGH DEDUCTIBLE insurance. Do you know what that is? Do you know how that works? You pay for the privilege of ""having insurance"" that covers hardly anything short of catastrophes. Ex: You pay several hundreds a month, only to have to reach insane deductibles like 10k (something most people can't reach without a hospital stay/ surgery) for them to start paying for your bills. That's not healthcare pal. That's a fkn scam.           

Idk where this idea about healthcare comes from in the US (propaganda I guess?) But you're not the first I've seen (nor will you be the last) that seems to really believe American healthcare is that simple, or cheap, for poor people, and it's totally false. I find it frightening."

Being homeless in the US is also very different from being homeless in many European countries, as social security is much stronger, and people have access to health care. But yes, I agree that in some European countries (France and Germany for example), homelessness has been normalized to an alarming degree.

My point was that even middle-class people expect there to be some sort of safety nets in place. People working in jobs requiring high expertise are the ones who vote and have a lot of influence over societies. They might not care about those who have fallen outside their scope, but they'll be very angry if they are left with nothing. They thought they were the backbone of society."
