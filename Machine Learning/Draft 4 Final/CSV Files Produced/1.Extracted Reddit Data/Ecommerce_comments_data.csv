Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Fear is a very strong primary emotion. Makes us do crazy things. I have seen people really fear AI. So they invest a lot of time disproving its need or how it is useless. Some are closet haters.

The reality is - the world is changing and tech is getting into business and either you embrace it or you say it doesn't exist till its too late and you are not able to use it to your advantage.

What are your thoughts?"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","My wife worked for a Fortune 200 company alongside 70,000 other employees. Her job was assigning numbers to spreadsheets. Trivial effort, but without it being done, their factory to warehouse logistics would grind to a halt.   Some kid could probably write an app to do that work in an afternoon.  It seems like a lot of jobs of a similar nature are equally replaceable. I hope that anyone doing that sort of work can be freed from it. The problem is not ""is it possible"", but how do we all work less and not be deprived of food, shelter, healthcare, and security. Right now the profits created by a reduced workforce go straight into shareholders pockets. That model will not work when it pushes millions out of unnecessary jobs."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","AI won’t take your job, someone that knows how to use AI will."

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Not at all. AI can do a ton of things, but I work in a support role for aircraft maintenance and have a hands-on aspect of my job. Computers cannot replicate half of my responsibilities. There will always be a physical aspect to my job."

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","A lot of people think this is as good as AI gets. Trust me if it stops here we'll be alright. But it won't. Graphic Designers and Artists were thought to be the last to be replaced yet they are slowly flowing to the chopping block. Throw the rulebook out and just watch how ""it's helping me with my job"" becomes ""wait.....stop"". 

I'm all for it. World's going to shit anyway. Let's speed this bad boy up and get to the new civilization of living instead of working. Think aliens are out there doing labor to survive? Probably not because they have more important things to do like interstellar travel."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Wow a lot of you guys really have no idea of 1)what AI is and what it is already capable of and the fact that it's brand new so this is just the beginning 2) how many people have ALREADY lost their jobs to AI. No amount of government programs changes the fact that we are not taken care of (American here), it's every man for himself. It doesn't matter if there's less need for work, the people who will benefit the most are corporations whos profits will go up and even though the number of employees lowers, the wages will not raise. And the people who lose those jobs are on their own, you think the company cares how long or hard they've worked there? They care about the fact they can make more money for less. AI could be a wonderful tool if we had the foresight or empathy to use it right. But humans just don't know how to act. We've already taken it too far, I just hope they figure out a way to regulate this soon, and the impact is lessened."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","I think there’s a lot of fear mongering with AI. Look at AI as a tool, not as a sentient being out to steal your job. There are only a few jobs that AI could 100% take over, and even then they would need the input by a human. Most jobs are going to see AI integrated as a tool. 

The bigger threat is losing your job to someone who understands how to utilize AI to get better output"

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?",I don't think we're really thinking ahead and how exponentially smarter AI will become in just a short time.
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","I can never be scared of AI taking over what I do , instead it makes me even better at what I do. Developing contents has never been easier for me before chatGPT came, also trading the crypto space got even better and faster for me using TokenMetrics AI powered platform.

Knowing what you do, AI will only come as an assistant and not your replacement"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?",if you know how to leverage AI it only improves your productivity. I am currently using ChatGPT and copilot for everything and it really is a gamechanger. But you still have to understand programming and the concepts since you can't build a full application with it. The main benefit is that it takes away lots of small time consuming things.
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","I have no fear of AI taking my job. My combination of automated and manual methods and strategies is, I am quite sure, not reproducible."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","AI may make certain aspects of my job easier but it won’t take over my job, it’s just too diverse. Besides unless it comes with a fully functional android, manufacturing and shipping are going to cease."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","I use AI to help me develop simple app using VBA. Maybe I can pay people to develop that app, but with AI, I don't need to anymore and I can save some money + learn new things. So ditto with what u/EffectiveEfficiency said"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Not at all. The people who need to worry are the ones who use ""A-I"" (emphasis on air quotes) or the delusional minds who think that ""A-I"" will help them take an actual professional's job. It won't."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","AI will only make things easier for the one who knows how to use it. When a professional and a beginner uses ChatGPT, you'll always see the difference"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","At the moment AI is the worst it will ever be, which means it's only going to get better from here, making it crucial for people to adopt AI or risk being left behind in this rapidly advancing technology-driven world."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Well all I do now is get high, stress out about not getting enough sales and then waste hours and hours creating new ad campaigns that will barely hit 2x ROAS. Pretty sure AI could do most of that, but why?"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?",I'm not scared of AI taking my job per se but most likely changing my job function or even helping with it. I am concerned about how the younger generations will be once AI becomes more and more prevalent in our lives.
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","In no way. AI is capable of a wide range of tasks, however I work in a hands-on support position for aircraft maintenance. Half of my duties cannot be duplicated by computers. My job will always involve some sort of physical activity."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","No if a company is ""new"" like shein it's easy to implement AI and build models for existing jobs it will take too long to build a model for all the nuances. Also organisations don't embrace change as much as we think. I use AI to help study and learn but it's a long way away from replacing a person"

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Indeed today, AI is becoming more intertwined with business. It's important to embrace these advancements and understand their potential benefits.   
  
Embracing technology allows us to adapt, innovate, and stay competitive. By recognizing the opportunities AI presents and actively seeking ways to leverage it, we can position ourselves for success in a tech-driven world."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","I truly believe there is a great potential in AI. The question is who will benefit from it? Being scared of AI taking the job - I don't that's the point. 

Instead, think about making AI your friend and now instead of wasting 1-2 days of labor you could solve the problem in hours if not minutes. Just leverage the tool.

I shared some practical tips on how I use the ChatGPT as an engineer [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13mmuxu/comment/jl9pweb/?context=3)"

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","because the cost of resources is going to zero.

In 1950, there were 10 million farmers.  Now there are 3 million and we produce substantially more food.  The cost (inflation adjusted) for wheat, corn, and soybeans is about 1/4 what it cost in the 1970s.

Removing humans from work will mean humans have less money (or more likely that a new economy emerges just like the engine and PC disrupted economies), but it will also mean that things cost less because the producers of those things don't have to pay labor costs, which is one of the biggest drivers of cost."

Yes I agree with you - How do we all work less and benefit from technology around us, instead of the savings going into pockets of just few people."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Yes that’s because making an app to do it is just a whole other layer of problems, your wife can adapt by explaining her the change, if it’s an app you need someone to maintain and update it. Just like AI, software isn’t magic."

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","You leave out the part about a small elite group of men holding 99% of the power and deciding everyone's fate. You can't be powerful if everyone is equal and they LOVE power. Pretty sure we're more likely to have to work more, not less."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","While total replacement is not as far off as you intimate, you've brushed on the issue as it pertains to us now. 

AI makes people much more productive. And with increased individual productivity comes less need for bodies. Departments that were once 20 people will likely shrink to maybe 5 very soon. Many jobs will be lost in this manner."

What happens if cost of resources go to zero, what gets costlier and why would a general person earn? Peace of mind?"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","We have MORE than enough food to feed every person in America and yet 1 in 6 children are hungry. The issue has not been about resources for a very long time. Humans won't have less money, the general population will have less money. Labor is not the biggest driver of cost in major corporations, the need to beat (not even meet) last years profits is the reason. This has nothing to do with numbers, its all greed"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?",Well things definitely haven't been costing less lately.
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Yes, she needed a job with health insurance because of a preexisting condition. Most of the incentive to work these days is to have the resources to not starve, to not be homeless, and to be able to see a doctor when you need to."

Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","because instead of giant corporations employing everyone, people are realizing how easy it is to be self employed and we are benefiting directly in our pockets."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","That wasn't the point. So much human activity can and should be replaced by AI and automation. But that disrupts the relationship between work and income. We are getting along just fine with fewer bank tellers,  retail clerks, office typing pools, sign painters, jewelry wax carvers, and other jobs automated out of existing. And because there are limits to growth, we can't expect that we can grow new jobs for all those unneeded people. I think thats part of the reason we are seeing record numbers of homeless camps and refugees. And at the same time, record numbers of megawealthy people that are the primary benefactors of all those productivity gains from AI and automation. The overall system needs to evolve."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Everyone has power in their own ways, including money, number of people, influence, goods, or services. If the population loses its currency due to job loss we have strength in numbers. Who knows how it turns out, no one does. Just along for the ride."
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","lol I’m willing to bet “total AI takeover” is overblown. All of you are talking about it like it’s matter of fact, even though the technology capable of doing so hasn’t even been released"

Actually this is my biggest fear, the disparity in wealth. Also, those are in power and have money, determine the fate to everyone else. If they are not responsible, world goes to hell. Basically we'll be living the vision of a handful of people"
Ecommerce,"Be Honest, Are you scared of AI taking over your job?","Yes I got that part, but this wont be the motivation, what’s happening is that while being a breakthrough, it’s not magic, and using them requires expertise that a lot of people don’t have even decades after it appeared.

For the point yes, capitalism says there’s a big cake and everyone takes his piece. The problem is the cake is not very varied, apart from some life-threating needs like food/shelter/communication/etc most things we buy are not really necessary but still exist in great variety. Just because someone had to make them to not die, and I’m pretty sure there’s like 90% of us that just work to not die, instead of working because it’s actually needed."
