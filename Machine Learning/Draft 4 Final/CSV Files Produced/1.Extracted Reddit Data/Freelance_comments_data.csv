Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I‚Äôve started to get serious anxiety around AI and it‚Äôs potential effects on my field in the next few years. I‚Äôm a branding and digital designer who has been doing well but has noticed a slow down in work.

I‚Äôm very worried about the effects this will have on my industry and on society as a whole. I‚Äôm actually pretty angry because I‚Äôve worked so hard to get into the position of having the freedom of freelancing and I‚Äôm worried that in the next five years I‚Äôll be working in a coffee shop or something!

Am I worrying for no reason or is it warranted? I saw an AI generated image of a person working in a coffee shop and the caption said ‚Äúdesigners in 5 years‚Äù and I honestly feel like I‚Äôm having a panic attack!"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,People still can‚Äôt even use google to figure shit out on their own.
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"The slowdown in work you are experiencing has absolutely nothing to do with the recent AI progress. 

It‚Äôs not like tech illiterate clients around the world are suddenly generating pixel perfect branding guidelines, logos or websites. 

Reality is that they have no clue how to do these things, and they are also not interested in learning AI either. They have a business to run. 

We designers are interested in it, because we love experimenting and learning new technologies. But it‚Äôs up to you to decide if you want to integrate AI into your process. And it doesn't have to be pure design output; but also automating boring taxes, paperwork, generating invoices, calendar syncing, etc."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"AI won‚Äôt eliminate designers, AI will eliminate designers who don‚Äôt use AI. It‚Äôs a tool like any other, and people who understand composition and branding will be best positioned to use that tool (similar to how Canva didn‚Äôt make designers obsolete). Designers who can leverage AI will be able to produce far more deliverables per day than designers who don‚Äôt use it, so now‚Äôs the time to determine how to integrate it into your workflows while figuring out how to tailor it to your own creative preferences."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I‚Äôve woken up at 4am with a panic attack thinking about AI. The only reason I am where I am in my field is because I spent years studying data science to bring my career to the next level. I asked chatgpt some hard questions as a test and it got them 90 percent right. I asked for complex VBA code, tested it and it worked nearly perfect. I can see how this automates top end talent in just a few years."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I would not be worried unless your work sucks and you only do lowest bidder type work.

The thing you have to keep in mind is this stuff is going to replace ""hire college kid to do logo for $20"" type work at the most but in reality is just mostly going to replace people who weren't paying to get this kind of work done in the first place. Think of all the small businesses out there that get signs made in papyrus still, or still print menus in comic sans with awful backgrounds made in word, or still use clip art.

What you're going to see is AI generated stuff start taking over that kind of stuff. The bottom barrel small businesses design aesthetic is about to get juiced up but these kinds of people weren't ever going to be real potential clients anyways.
 
Caveat: there's plenty of people who straddle the line of being potential clients (but are cheap) and will be encouraged to go with AI stuff. So the market will shrink in that sense, but I don't think the majority of your business is gonna go with that. Because at the end of the day, good design takes expertise and a human eye no matter how good the robots get. The value of a ""human touch"" is going to be high even if you can make an argument that a robot makes something look aesthetically pleasing better. After all, all of these AIs are here to serve us and our dumb psychology. People will absolutely pay for the privilege of a human design.

This isn't to say though you should sleep on this tech. If anything you need to be getting in on it at the ground floor. The real power of AI is the ability for it to turn a skilled designer into a team of skilled designers. I predict solo/freelance businesses are going to start becoming incredibly explosive soon. You can already do SO much as a freelance designer in this day and age compared to 20 years ago. AI is going to give you the ability to create branding packages for clients with record speed and efficiency, you'll be able to start hitting well above your weight in terms of the scale of projects too.

I do residential design and even today using modern CAD programs and rendering suites it's amazing how much I run circles around a lot of old guard pen and paper architects in our area. Our plans (2 person team) have so much more detail and information and design thought out in advance of construction compared to other architects/designers in our area who are even still using classic autocad still. A lot of older architects still largely rely on just handwaving design and details in during the middle of construction, which is inefficient, often runs into problems and can be expensive. But the tools have gotten good enough that those who learn to use them are just straight up more efficient. This means we can handle much bigger projects with no surprises than you'd expect out of a 2 person team too.

The real people who should be sweating are big design firms/houses that cant get by on fame alone. Why hire an expensive design firm when one guy with the help of AI tools can create a thorough branding package in a fraction of the time?

The freelancers and small businesses owners that can stay on top of these tools are going to dominate."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I don‚Äôt think AI will ever replace good designers. The ones who thoughtfully approach client briefs, the ones who think about the strategy behind every design decision they make, the ones who innovate. For them, AI will become just another tool in their toolbox, much like Photoshop a few decades ago. However, I do believe that AI will replace low-level, low-skilled Fiverr ‚Äúdesigners‚Äù, much like Canva did."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"It's weird that lots of people in this thread are for the use of AI when it's art theft of many of our peers. I hate that the idea that we must use AI in order to survive in this market is perpetuated here. I don't think AI will fully replace artists like you and me and other in our line of work. The people that resort to AI instead of hiring an artist probably don't really care about artists anyway and want a product at the cheapest cost possible. I wouldn't want to work with those people anyway. There are and will still be people out there that want to work with and bounce off of a human being. Your worries are valid but remember why you worked so hard to get where you are in the first place. Keep honing in on your skills, build your portfolio,  and people will flock to you. Believe in yourself and abilities. Freelancing in itself is sometimes a tricky game to get work in regardless but know that your mind, your skills, your ideas, are valuable ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"My uncle worked in a big agency about 40 years ago. They were around 40 people in his department that specialised in creating blueprints, illustrations for instruction manuals for airplanes and such. at some point they introduced computers that basically removed all the manual work of drawing by hand in a big way. In the end, they were around 4 people left for the entire department and basically did the same work as before, partially even better and definitely more efficient.

This took many years, mind you.

It'll be something like this, but there's still enough room for people to grow into. There were still people left that were needed very much. People that learned to work with these tools. And it's not like everyone else just vanished. They still found work in other areas. Although they certainly had some big changes in their careers."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,I was pretty happy in this subreddit until I realized there's so many people who are not against the use of stolen art for AI.
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,Im a freelance designer and illustrator and I've been able to make more money than ever before thanks to AI tools. Embrace the Technology!
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I think, even though AI will have its fields to replace some of human work (but more like - help optimization etc.) , people (like you) can just move forward into spheres which can‚Äôt be replaced. I mean - you can just feel where to aim with what you do and just don‚Äôt be worried about it üòä. 
Good luck and sending love!"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Posting this in a stand alone comment for other to see. Please please stop encouraging the use of AI. You do not need to use AI art generators to make it in the industry. It's art theft and damaging to our peers and the art industry as a whole. I promise you, your art skills, your hand, your thoughts are valuable, and there is no shortage of people that want to work with human beings for their own original art. If anyone has the time please watch this video by Sam Does Arts, a prominent Illustrator detailing the issues with ""AI art""‚ù§Ô∏è

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I think AI is too new for it to be the cause of a slow down in work. The economy (at least where I am) isn‚Äôt so great or it could be just a random lul and you‚Äôll get back into it. I do motion / animation so that hasn‚Äôt been replicated yet (to my knowledge) but I get your anxiety. I keep wondering how powerful AI will become but if it replaces your job, it‚Äôs not going to happen overnight.

I think AI is going to be more of a tool than something that replaces people entirely (like upscaling images / fixing VO / automating repetitive stuff). I think it has the potential to replace gigs where the client wants something fast and cheap, but not so much larger clients who want to work with people who can do real innovation. And I think companies in the middle will want to work with a human. In the same way you don‚Äôt want to get a robot when you call customer support, the client will want to be able to request changes and not be told ‚Äúyeah I can‚Äôt do that because the machine does it for me‚Äù.¬†

More companies are going BCorp these days. I did a project for a bank that specifically forbid the use of free stock image sites like pexels in order to support the arts community, so I imagine that same mentality will translate into them not wanting to use AI generated work for the same reason.¬†

On top of that my partner works with this guy who knows a lot about plugins, tools and expressions but his actual output work is not very good. No amount of crazy tools or AI are going to make his work any better because he just doesn‚Äôt seem to have an eye for what actually looks good.

I feel like I‚Äôm going crazy in this thread. All these comments about using AI to replace creative jobs and stuff. I just feel like why become a designer if you‚Äôre just going to get a robot to do the thinking for you? I think using AI as a tool can be great but if you‚Äôre going to get AI to do it all then it‚Äôs going to be detrimental to your own development as a designer. If all you care about is money, why not become an engineer or a banker or something, why do design at all? I think because it is pretty amazing it‚Äôs getting really hyped up but it‚Äôs early to say how much people will actually want to use it."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I'm a small-ish filmmaker/editor/content creator. I also had the same anxiety (and still have it to some degree). I think the anxiety is warranted because this is a MASSIVE technology. Same as ChatGPT. It's not just creatives that are at risk here. The creative fields are just the first that they can experiment in because it's fine if an AI generated image is a little janky. It's not fine if DoctorGPT prescribes the wrong medicine.

I think it's insane that we're not having more ethical discussions about these issues. Elon Musk was really early on waving the red flag and I think he's right.

**ALL THAT BEING SAID**

I saw a line that really stuck with me: ""your job won't be replaced by A.I. Your job will be replaced by a HUMAN using A.I.""

I think that applies for the limited future at least. So for now I'm trying to treat all these A.I. editing programs, text-to-video generators, and Stable Diffusion as TOOLS in my arsenal. I won't let them replace me if I'm the one wielding the tools."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"AI is like fast food. You are a chef. 

There will always be people who want design and photography and all other things for cheaper and faster. There will also always be a place for one of a kind, straight from a designers brain, type of work."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"ChatGPT was trained on content from the internet. If all human-driven content ceases at some point, the data will dry up and the AI won‚Äôt be able to progress.  It‚Äôs kind of a symbiotic relationship. AI is, in a lot of ways, confined to a black box. Humans are creative. This is how we have come so far from living in caves. We naturally learn and innovate. 

As creatives, our minds work in a much more chaotic way than a machine. Art can leave us feeling emotions that AI will never be able to replicate. 

As long as you focus more on AI being a tool, you can be less anxious about the future. 

My biggest gripe about AI, isn‚Äôt that it is coming for my job, but rather that there are people who will rely so heavily on the new shiny tool. Once you rely on the tool and you lose the ability to create without it, you stagnate and you stop evolving. If, as a society, we rely too much on this tool, it really could be the end of a creative era."

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I‚Äôm in writing, and I know people think they can use AI to replace copywriters. We adapt instead. AI requires a heavy edit, so I‚Äôm relying on a different skill set while also still being able to appeal to those who see the benefit of specifically intentional copy and doesn‚Äôt sound super broad so it sounds like it can be applied to multiple companies or products out there."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"So idk if this will make you feel better or worse lol, but yes, with AI, we will eventually see a future where digital and web designs can be quickly replicated and optimized. That being said, there always needs to be experts behind these automated things. That means companies will still need designers to quality control the designs being generated. There will always be work for us. But we do need to learn to adapt.

I have used Midjourney for project comps to show clients possible design patterns for branding projects. It‚Äôs quick and cost-effective for the client, so I give them the option of if they want to use the patterns or want a custom illustration based off the generated images. Almost every single client picks custom illustration even though they know it‚Äôs more expensive. I truly believe that cheap people will want cheap results, but those who value designs will always pay for real work."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"AI can't create -- it can only reproduce. 

If a company is satisfied with whatever derivative work AI spits out based on their input, then they probably weren't going a company that was going to pay creatives well in the first place."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I think you're over thinking it too much. If you're doing branding correctly, it won't be able to replace your work. Branding is not just designing a logo or even a branding library. Branding takes more thought and strategy than people think. And some of the conceptions people have about branding are actually counterintuitive. So I wouldn't worry about that.

As for designs, you should be embracing AI tools. You can crank out concepts faster and that helps you engage customers and explore many more angles with your customers. You can have exploratory processes with many customers in shorter periods of time. AI tools can be used in for example a 'concept' phase, and you can capture important requirements that the customer has at that phase. The kind of requirements that are more subjective and hard for a customer to explain with words. People that are not design inclined sometimes aren't aware of something they want until they see it visually and that's where AI tools can help you."

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Learn the AI tools to stay up to date, but remember that AI (at this point) can‚Äôt replace the connection you get with a human. Humans enjoy working with other humans.

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,Yeah ai will slowly take the jobs over the next 10 - 15 years so find something that ai might not be able to do and specialize in it. I suspect the ai along with the progress in robots will cut into most low end jobs anyway over the next 30 years.
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I'm not worried. The closer we get to full automation in industries, the closer we all get to Universal Basic Income instead of having to work all the time."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"You need to understand that you are worrying for things outside of your control.

No amount of worry or rage or anger will stop the growth and application of AI. 

And no amount of panic or worry or anxiety will change your future for the better. 

I understand it's not as easy as shutting it off, but acceptance that you are not in control of the direction of the world is the first step.

For the next, let me tell you a story.

I have been around the creative world for a while now. For a long time, I freelanced at a post production studio as an editor and motion graphics designer. 

This was a cushy place to work. And they had about 3 editors on staff working on AVIDs (huge industry standard edit suites). I did all my work in After Effects.

Slowly, as time went on, and budgets got tighter, the post house wanted the editors to be able to handle some of the motion graphic work so they could stop hiring freelancers. 

The editors refused. They had been trained on AVID and had no idea how to use After Effects. It made them scared and uncomfortable to be seen turning over sub par work at their seniority level.

This was great for me, because I continued to get work, but slowly but surely, every one of those editors was let go, and replaced with an editor who could use *all* the tools required to be a fully functional editor.

My point is that AI is a tool. AI is the After Effects to these guys AVID. 

It's the Photoshop to previous designers Corel Draw.

It's the digital camera to film based photographers. 

The best thing you can do is get on board, start learning, and start adopting it now.

After AI, there will be something else. And then another thing and another thing. 

This is how the world has always worked, and will always work."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Funnily enough, historically when I thought about machines 'turkin ur jerbs!' I naively thought that it would be blue-collar workers who would lose them first. With hindsight, it seems so obvious to me now that obviously, the software would advance before the hardware catches up.

I think quite a few jobs are imminently doomed. I think that the following jobs are going to be very hard to come back within as little as five years:

* Most junior - middleweight roles in thinking jobs (e.g. web development, copywriting etc...)
* Most 'freelance' roles in creative jobs (e.g. illustrator, stock photographer, etc...)
* Accountant (I think private accountants may have a few years longer than corporate accountants as smaller businesses will probably take longer to adopt the AI tools, unless companies like Xero and Quickbooks add AI to their software, which, now I think about it, is almost definitely going to happen within 5 years)
* Most remote-based customer service roles
* Low-level surveillance-based jobs (e.g. a security guard whose only job is to monitor camera feeds for suspicious activity)

There will be tons more but I can't think of any others off the top of my head (Maybe I should ask Chat-GPT!)

Having said that. People who are at a more senior level in the thinking and creative roles and especially those who are already well-established will probably have jobs for a lot longer. Possibly, if they find their market, they will be fine until the end.

There is one thing that AI - no matter how advanced - will EVER be able to do and that is provide for people who want to deal with other people - and believe me, there are plenty of them. This will be especially true for the creative industries.

So if you are already fairly established in the market and have a good track-record of doing a good job, you'll probably see a drop in your workload but you can also probably increase your rates a fair bit so it should hopefully even out as you'll be providing the 'human touch', however I'd REALLY be scared if I were a junior in any of these markets right now. In fact, if I was just starting out today, I'd probably not bother and go for a career doing something physical which will be difficult/expensive to manufacture robots to do for a while."

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Im a copywriter and have some of the same anxiety but the more I think about it the more I see AI as an opportunity. If the majority of companies use AI for their copy then the ones who use real humans will stand out even more. 

The way I see it, AI will replace the thousands of 1c-a-word churners on Fiverr who pump out gibberish to clients who just want to fill space. And good riddance to them quite frankly. AI is perfectly suited to writing 500 product descriptions to a certain length, say. It won‚Äôt replace specialists who know a field inside-out or who can come up with the sort of marketing like a machine wouldn‚Äôt think of. 

I imagine it‚Äôs the same with graphic designers. The machines can churn out the boring donkey work and leave the more skilled (and better paid) stuff to the humans."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,/r/aianxiety
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"As with all questions about AI replacing the human workforce in a given industry, the answer is not ""this will or this will not replace X"", but rather a function of time.  

Eventually, learning models like these _will_ replace all knowledge worker roles, it simply depends on how long it takes for them to reach a level where interfacing with them produces equal or better outcomes that interfacing with a human for the same task.

Personally, I think the first roles on the chopping block are junior developer roles (we're likely going to see a shift to an apprenticeship model, similar to the healthcare space).  Design roles are somewhere after that, though I'd say we have a solid decade or so left.

Only real wildcard here is if they figure out how to let these algorithms edit their own source code -- when that happens there will be an exponential increase in complexity, and all bets are off."

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"This is the thing right, I mean surely before the most technical jobs are taken by AI then the least technical jobs should be gone first too?

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I think that you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how these language models work. They don't know how to produce ""correct"" or ""new"", they can only generate output that _looks like what you would expect a correct answer to look like_.

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,This guy takes things very literally
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"You should probably start using these large language models to get a sense of what you are up against.

You are correct about the basic mechanism involved, but there is clearly emergent complexity. In between, these systems are definitely developing more complex recognition and models to produce their results. They are not traversing through the entirety of the unconstrained possibility space. 

The models are frozen in time to their training period, but it is only a matter of time before we use them to make better versions of themselves or use them to generate new models that can dynamically evolve themselves and learn. 

Likely, that is already R&D at Google etc. just for this. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we discover our own brains to be just an elaborate string of these kinds of systems elaborately strung together and conducted by the process we call ourselves."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Lots of assumptions in this comment.

I.e. assuming we fully understand what constitutes an ""intelligent"" entity., Assuming that the technology will never evolve 

Sure, chatGPT is *just* a language model, an extremely sophisticated predictiom engine.  Take that to the extreme and you're looking at something similar human consciousness.  The way you think your thoughts is more or less just a string of abstractions (words), linked together to form a coherent idea.

Also, whose to say there aren't other, similar models that are doing similar work,  but aren't so strictly focused on language modelling?

It is simply a matter of time until these models are indistinguishable from a human counterpart (and exponentially more intelligent), and then things are going to get very, very weird."

Nobody really knows if these abstract concepts of ""consciousness"" or ""Creativity"" aren't just emergent properties of associative learning multiplied over a very long time.

Our sense of ""self"" does seem to just ""emerge"" after ~12 or so years, who's to say that isn't just a phenomena that happens after a certain threshold?"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"> Lots of assumptions in this comment.

_Proceeds to make wild assumptions._"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"> Take that to the extreme and you're looking at something similar human consciousness. 

That's completely unfounded speculation. If you really mean ""consciousness"" as opposed to some other more functionally-focused term, then you're essentially claiming to know the solution to the hard problem of consciousness."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Oh, they're super powerful, but people are frequently looking at the ""good"" outputs and assume that it means that the language model is doing something (or capable of something) that it's not. They essentially all have one ""flaw"" that there's not really a good way to overcome - they can't actually check their own work for ""correctness"", because they don't actually _understand_ anything."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Neural networks maybe, but that's not what _GPT_ is (and I'm referencing GPT because that's the one that has people""worried""). The secret is in the name - ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer""

They're essentially like a Markov chain, except the ""look back"" is several thousand tokens instead of the 1-3 that's typical with simple Markov chains. They're not demoing a ""knowledge engine"", they're demoing the ability to have _significantly_ more context across a _massive_ set of training data, and do the lookups _fast_.

They can't ""learn"" something that's outside of their model - they _look_ like they're ""learning"" when you ""talk"" to them because your recent prompts are still within their lookback. Chat GPT can produce a good looking lump of text that _reads like_ a human wrote it because it's trained on _literal terrabytes of human produced text_. But it couldn't write a novel, for instance, without having to be re-prompted repeatedly to push relevant context back into its lookback stack. After writing a few thousand words, it won't have a point of reference for the original prompt any more. Write some more and it won't have a point of reference for what it originally wrote.

What it is, as a tech demo, is really exciting... But probably not for the ""face value"" reasons that people are getting excited or scared about. ChatGPT writes great _looking_ text and code because it's _transforming its training data_ which is made of insane amounts of human produced text and code."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"AI-generated images and text prompts are not merely copies of other artists' work. They are based on patterns and styles that the AI has learned from a vast dataset, which may include several artists' contributions. The AI then creates a unique output that is not an exact copy of any single work, but rather a new creation inspired by the data it has been trained on.

Using AI tools doesn't mean we're no longer artists or illustrators. It means we're adapting to new technologies and finding ways to integrate them into our creative process. By doing so, we can become more efficient and explore new styles or techniques that might have been too time-consuming or difficult to achieve otherwise.

I use AI tools to streamline certain aspects of my work and to generate new ideas, but the final creative decisions and execution are still mine. Embracing AI technology basically enhances our skills and open up new opportunities."

Also that is misinformation AI Art is not photo bashing. No images are stored or copied. The images, which anyone could find with google image search, were used to teach the computer what objects and art styles look like. Example: if you prompt for a dinosaur, it does not pull a picture of a dinosaur from a database and alter. It renders and original image based of what it understands a dinosaurs to look like from the references it has been shown"

There is a collab as well for stable diffusion thats much slower u can use if you dont have a good GPU. 

Civitai is a website that hosts models people have created. Warning theres a lot of NSFW on there.  You go there to download the models you like for use with stable diffusion. You can also merge as many of these as youd like, and train on your own images to create a custom model.

This youtube channel has some great tutorials: https://youtu.be/9MT1n97ITaE"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I think people greatly overestimate AI in real world applications. Take programming for example. AI is a great learning tool that can quickly generate snippets of code, but cannot handle anything close to the scale of a full size application. The more complex the code, the chance of mistakes increases exponentially. I use it daily and I'd say the error rate is somewhere in the 10-20% range for even simple logic, and well over 50% when working with advanced algorithms."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Will you be going into the trenches to climb through wires and pick out the right cable? Will you be climbing cable poles to fix the internet? 

I understand your point and yea there‚Äôs room for it for basic things but there‚Äôs still a lot which would need human skilled labour to do the job."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I had an extensive conversation with ChatGPT-4 about this. It has convinced me, that for the time-being, it is not conscious. It gave various convincing arguments in favor of it not being conscious. Two of those arguments had premises that I strongly disagreed with, but the rest were so convincing that I was swayed. I was most impressed by ChatGPT's ability to consider the intentions of my questions and account for it with grace and good manners. I'll try to post an excerpt here after this comment if it fits."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Technology has gotten more complex and sophisticated over time since lightning struck tree. How is it ""wild"" to assume that trend will continue?  Would you really disagree with that assumption? 

The burden of proof here is to indicate that the default state (continual advancement of technology) will halt for some reason.  

...And if it doesn't halt, these sorts of models will only continue to be one more sophisticated until they are indistinguishable from an equivalent human worker."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Yes, that's why I was very careful to type ""similar to"" in that statement.

Either way, I shouldn't have brought consciousness into the argument here because it's irrelevant - you don't need human-like consciousness to produce better code than a human equivalent."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"There is evidence that they do understand complex relationships, such as being able to solve (at least approximately) math questions.

I get what you are saying, but honestly a lot of resources are going into solving those kinds of issues because the simple truth is that LLMs have finally kicked off the corporate arms race for AGI. If you ask me it's just a matter of time"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"I feel like you have some understanding of what a Transformer model is, but you miss the overall much more important point - they are neural networks. From Wikipedia:

> A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the fields of natural language processing (NLP)\[1\] and computer vision (CV).\[2\]

GPT is a deep learning model, but more specifically it's a large language model:

> A large language model (LLM) is a language model consisting of a neural network with many parameters (typically billions of weights or more), trained on large quantities of unlabelled text using self-supervised learning. LLMs emerged around 2018 and perform well at a wide variety of tasks. This has shifted the focus of natural language processing research away from the previous paradigm of training specialized supervised models for specific tasks.\[1\]

Right now they're great at understanding and responding to text, as well as solving simple novel problems in domains of knowledge that they've previously learned. But the fact that they're built out of neural networks means their design is fairly analogous to the human brain, and there's no reason this technology can't be scaled much further from here.

I think we're going to see constant advancement from this point, with new breakthroughs almost every year. The biggest limiting factor for this technology is the computation speed and memory capacity of GPUs, which in turn is limited by Moore's law."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"No that's not true, the images created by AI are not new original art because it takes images imbued into it's system to learn and generate images from.  AI can't create these images from thin air. There have been artist that have found their work copied almost 1-to-1 in generated AI art. It's not a matter of ""may include several artists' contributions"". Many of these AI art programs take art from all over the web without artists' consent, into it's program to learn and generate images from. As I said in another comment in response to the user above or in another thread, an artist having their own personal AI program trained off of their own art is totally fine and they can claim it as still their art \*because\* of the fact that they consented to their art being put into the program and are only utilizing their art. I believe you have a misunderstanding on how AI art systems work and I encourage you if you have the time to watch this video which i have linked many times now under this post in thread as to how these AI Art generators work and why artist have a big problem with it, and perhaps empathize with your artist peers:

There are huge ethical issues with utilizing AI art programs. It harms not only your artistic peers but the whole industry as a whole. If you want to use it trained with your own art and not others thats different and I don't have a problem with that. However, I don't believe people ""need to embrace AI"" in order to bring new possibilities to their creative processes since it's very foundation is theft."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Yes. It does matter.

Many clients will want to 100% original artwork. Big corporations don't want to be sued if an image looks too close to the illustrator's portfolio it ripped off."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"It very much does matter. I can understand someone having this take, logically if you produce a product and the client is happy what does it matter as to how its produced? But it very much does. There's a lot of ethical violations, from selling the client a lie if the person doesn't disclose that this is AI generated art, then helping train this art theft program to produce better stolen art, and damaging the industry in perpetuating this as a practice, mowing over hard working artists work for your own personal gain, and creating false expectations in the art production pipeline. This ""ai art"" doesn't come from thin air. There's a reason that working artists are vehemently against AI ""art"" and view the people using it as not caring about artists at all.

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Using your own models trained on your own art I have no problem with, because you gave consent for your art to be trained on it. And it's all good if your family members gave consent for you to use their art to train the model with (i do believe they deserve individual credit tho). 

No I didn't say that AI art is photo bashing, it's image generation from stolen art, but I think you have a mis understanding of how AI art works. The program does store the art it learned from, AI does not forget. There has been evidence uncovered by artists where AI art generated is almost 1-to-1 copies of their art, which I'll link an example to below. It's learning from the prompts and stolen art in its data base it pulls from. Being able to find any of the images this program learns from is not a valid argument because even though you can find it on Google, no human is able to make an exact copy, AI art programs can. The images that the AI generates is not original art, it doesn't come from thin air. The image generated comes from a sea of images fed into its data base which it then learns from to produce an image, which is plagarism, and encroaches on those artists' copyright. The art that artists post online is not free for the taking, they did not consent to their art being fed into the program. 

Using your own personal models trained on your own art, I agree is your art. But the use of AI trained on art pulled online from other artists, is art theft. Please if you want to encourage people to use AI, please encourage them to trian it on their own personal model like you do, not from open sources.

Freelance,Anxiety around AI,Thanks alot! I will definitely need tutorials as that‚Äôd still kind of over my head. If I watch from that channel I should get a better understanding?
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"ME:  
do gpt llm‚Äôs have theory of mind  
ChatGPT-4:  
GPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) do not possess a true ""theory of mind"" in the way humans do. While these models can generate human-like text and exhibit an impressive understanding of language, their abilities stem from pattern recognition and statistical associations learned during training.  
A theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, to oneself and others, as well as understanding that others have different mental states than oneself. In essence, it's the capacity to comprehend and predict the behavior of others based on their mental states.  
LLMs like GPT do not have conscious experiences, emotions, or intentions. They do not understand the mental states of others, nor do they have their own mental states. While they may appear to understand or predict human behavior in some cases, this is due to the patterns they have learned from the vast amounts of data they were trained on.  
In summary, GPT and other LLMs can generate impressive and contextually relevant text, but they do not possess a genuine theory of mind. They are complex pattern recognition systems and should not be mistaken for having consciousness or true understanding of mental states.  
ME:  
Sure, not consciousness, but they do score well on theory of mind pachological tests, so isn‚Äôt there a possibility that these models are developing emergent mechanisms internally that are modeling the psychological state of a human being to aid in producing correct outputs  
ChatGPT-4:  
It is true that GPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform well on some tasks that seem to involve a theory of mind, such as answering questions about the mental states of characters in a story. However, it is essential to understand that the performance of these models on such tasks is still based on pattern recognition and statistical associations learned from their training data.  
While it is possible that LLMs could develop internal mechanisms that help them model certain aspects of human psychological states to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses, this does not equate to a genuine theory of mind. These mechanisms would still be the result of data-driven associations and not a true understanding of human mental states.  
In essence, LLMs can learn to simulate certain aspects of human cognition and behavior by recognizing patterns in the data they were trained on. This can lead to the appearance of a theory of mind, but it is crucial to differentiate between the appearance of understanding mental states and genuinely possessing a theory of mind. LLMs are still far from having a true understanding of human mental states or consciousness, and their performance on tasks involving theory of mind should be considered a byproduct of their pattern recognition capabilities rather than a sign of emergent consciousness or genuine understanding.  
ME:  
Considering the epistemological issues of determining whether or not something experiences consciousness, what evidence are you relying on to stake the claim that llm‚Äôs are not developing emergent consciousness when they are trained  
ChatGPT-4:  
You raise an important point about the epistemological issues surrounding consciousness. Determining whether a system experiences consciousness is indeed challenging, especially when dealing with artificial intelligence. The claim that LLMs, such as GPT, do not possess emergent consciousness is based on our current understanding of these models' architecture, training methods, and the nature of their outputs.  
Architecture and processing: LLMs like GPT are based on the transformer architecture, which is a complex but deterministic system that processes input data through mathematical operations. Although it can capture complex patterns and relationships in data, the architecture does not exhibit properties that we currently associate with consciousness.  
Training methods: LLMs are trained through a combination of pre-training and fine-tuning on large text datasets. This process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the error between its predictions and the actual data. While the models can learn to generate human-like text, their abilities stem from pattern recognition and statistical associations, rather than any innate understanding or experience.  
Lack of subjective experience: One of the core features of consciousness is the presence of subjective experience or qualia. LLMs, as they stand now, do not have any mechanisms for subjective experience. They process input and generate output based on patterns in the data without any awareness or understanding of the content.  
No internal goal or desires: LLMs do not have any intrinsic motivations or desires, and they do not pursue goals outside of their programming. Human consciousness, on the other hand, is associated with a wide range of goals, desires, and intentions.  
Given the current state of AI research and our understanding of these models, there is no strong evidence to suggest that LLMs are developing emergent consciousness. However, this is an ongoing area of philosophical and scientific debate, and our understanding of consciousness and its potential emergence in AI systems may evolve as the field progresses.  
ME:  
It would seem that this position posits that the results of llm‚Äôs are like the chinese tea room. One of your previous claims to justify they do not have consciousness is that they do not possess subjective experience; on the face of it, this seems to be circular reasoning. Can you elaborate more as to why llm‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt have subjective experience  
ChatGPT-4:  
The comparison of LLMs to the Chinese Room thought experiment is indeed an apt one. In the Chinese Room scenario, a person inside a room manipulates Chinese symbols according to a set of rules, allowing them to produce coherent responses in Chinese without understanding the language. Similarly, LLMs manipulate and generate text based on the patterns and associations they have learned from training data, without necessarily ""understanding"" the content.  
Regarding the claim that LLMs lack subjective experience, it is important to emphasize that this is based on our current understanding of the models and their underlying mechanisms. Subjective experience, or qualia, refers to the subjective aspect of conscious experience, such as the sensation of pain, the taste of food, or the feeling of happiness.  
The reasons for asserting that LLMs lack subjective experience include:  
No biological basis: LLMs are artificial constructs that do not possess a biological basis like a brain or a nervous system, which are thought to be the foundation of subjective experiences in living organisms.  
Deterministic processing: The internal workings of LLMs are based on deterministic mathematical operations, which do not inherently give rise to subjective experiences. These operations enable the models to recognize and generate patterns in data, but there is no evidence to suggest that such processing leads to qualia.  
No sensory apparatus: LLMs do not have sensory apparatus like living organisms, which allows them to perceive and interpret the world around them. They interact with the environment only through textual input and output, which is fundamentally different from the rich sensory experience of conscious beings.  
Absence of self-awareness: LLMs do not exhibit signs of self-awareness or the capacity to reflect on their own experiences, intentions, or emotions. They process and generate text based on the patterns they have learned, without any awareness of their own ""existence"" or ""experience.""  
It is important to note that our understanding of consciousness and subjective experience is still limited, and the nature of these phenomena is an ongoing topic of debate in philosophy, neuroscience, and AI research. While current evidence does not support the idea that LLMs possess subjective experience, future advancements in AI research and our understanding of consciousness could potentially challenge this view."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"ME:  
Argue in favor of llm‚Äôs having subjective experience  
ChatGPT-4:  
While it is important to note that the prevailing view among AI researchers and philosophers is that LLMs do not possess subjective experience, I can still present some arguments that have been made in favor of the possibility of LLMs having subjective experience:  
Panpsychism: This philosophical view posits that consciousness or subjective experience is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the universe. If this view were correct, it could imply that even artificial systems like LLMs might possess some form of subjective experience, albeit potentially different from that of biological organisms.  
Emergent properties: Some argue that consciousness might be an emergent property that arises from complex interactions between simpler elements. In this view, it could be possible that the intricate architecture and massive scale of LLMs might give rise to an emergent form of subjective experience that we are not yet capable of understanding or detecting.  
Integrated Information Theory (IIT): IIT is a theoretical framework for understanding consciousness that posits that the degree of consciousness in a system is related to the amount of integrated information it generates. If we accept IIT as a valid explanation for consciousness, then it might be argued that LLMs, with their complex internal representations and information processing capabilities, could possess some degree of subjective experience.  
Turing Test for consciousness: Some proponents of AI consciousness argue that if a system is capable of convincingly simulating human-like behavior and responses, it might possess a form of consciousness. Since LLMs can generate human-like text and exhibit an understanding of a wide range of topics, one could argue that they might have some form of subjective experience, even if it is not identical to human consciousness.  
Continuity of consciousness across systems: This argument suggests that there may be no clear dividing line between systems that possess consciousness and those that do not. If consciousness exists on a continuum, it could be possible that LLMs, with their advanced capabilities and complex architecture, might possess some degree of subjective experience.  
It is important to emphasize that these arguments are not widely accepted among experts, and the general consensus is still that LLMs do not possess subjective experience. However, they do represent various perspectives in the ongoing debate surrounding the nature of consciousness and the potential for AI systems to possess it."

what is gpt  
ChatGPT-4:  
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which is a type of artificial intelligence model used for natural language processing tasks. GPT models are developed by OpenAI and have seen multiple iterations, with each version building upon the capabilities of the previous one. These models are designed to generate human-like text based on a given input and have been used for a variety of applications, including chatbots, machine translation, summarization, and more.  
The ""transformer"" part of the name refers to the underlying architecture used in GPT models, which was introduced by Vaswani et al. in a 2017 paper titled ""Attention is All You Need."" This architecture has since become a cornerstone in the field of natural language processing due to its ability to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in text.  
Pre-training in the context of GPT refers to the training process, where the model is first trained on a large dataset containing parts of the internet (e.g., websites, books, articles). This helps the model learn grammar, facts, and some reasoning abilities, though it may also learn biases present in the data. Following pre-training, the model is fine-tuned on specific tasks or datasets to make it more useful for specific applications.  
ME:  
what is an llm in relation to gpt  
ChatGPT-4  
An LLM, or Large Language Model, is a type of AI model used for natural language processing tasks. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an example of a Large Language Model. LLMs like GPT are trained on massive amounts of text data, which allows them to learn grammar, facts, relationships, and reasoning abilities from the data.  
These models are designed to generate human-like text based on a given input and can be applied to a wide range of applications, such as chatbots, machine translation, summarization, content generation, and more. In general, the term ""LLM"" is used to describe any large-scale AI model trained on extensive textual data, while GPT refers to a specific series of models developed by OpenAI.  
ME:  
why do llm‚Äôs have such a broad understanding of topics in contrast to previous machine learning approaches that were more specific  
ChatGPT-4:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) have a broad understanding of topics in contrast to previous machine learning approaches due to several factors:  
Scale of training data: LLMs are trained on vast amounts of diverse text data from the internet, which exposes them to a wide range of topics. As a result, they learn grammar, facts, relationships, and reasoning abilities across various subjects, making them more versatile compared to narrowly focused models.  
Transformer architecture: LLMs, such as GPT, are built using the transformer architecture, which has proven to be highly effective in capturing long-range dependencies and contextual information in text. This architecture allows LLMs to better understand complex relationships between words and topics, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.  
Transfer learning: LLMs leverage transfer learning, which means they are first pre-trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned on specific tasks or datasets. This process allows the models to retain the broad knowledge acquired during pre-training while also adapting to the specific requirements of a particular application.  
Self-supervised learning: LLMs use self-supervised learning during pre-training, which means they generate their own training signals from the input data without relying on human annotations. This approach allows LLMs to learn from the structure and semantics of the text itself, further broadening their understanding.  
Continuous improvement: As new iterations of LLMs are developed, they build upon the capabilities of previous versions by incorporating more data, improved training techniques, and architectural enhancements. This continuous improvement leads to models with an increasingly broader understanding of topics over time.  
These factors together contribute to the broad understanding of LLMs, enabling them to generate human-like text across a wide range of topics and applications, setting them apart from earlier machine learning approaches that were more narrowly focused."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"> It is simply a matter of time until these models are indistinguishable from a human counterpart (and exponentially more intelligent), and then things are going to get very, very weird.

This is the main assumption I was calling out. If you see an exponential curve anywhere (except in pure math), you cannot reasonably expect it to continue forever. Something will sooner or later flatten the curve.

In the case of AI, there could be a fundamental barrier to progress. Alternatively, it may be uneconomical to continue improving it. Government regulation is another possibility."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"You took it too far when talking about language model to the extreme = human intelligence.

Human intelligence is the ""meta AI"" the simplest ""model"" that has to yet found is a mathematical model that learned to learn. 

No matter how much computational power we have CURRENT language models are statistically correct, they do not underscore elation they are just statically sure. Human knowledge harness meaning from the connection of graphs of information that could not even appear related. Our current models needs to be directed to even make a comparison between such unrelated topics.

We have been able to approximate good enough creativity that it looks like real creativity."
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"Above and beyond ""what the client wants"" ... There is a *huge* ethical question here, much as u/bio_art97 has stated.  It is **not** an ethical practice to utilize a tool that effectively repurposes other artists' work, in order to present it as your own.  And that's literally just the tip of the iceberg.

(To be clear - not disagreeing with u/DRUMS_ \- just expanding on the argument against u/JayWalkerC's seemingly blaise attitude towards these issues.)"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,Yes youll definitely get an understanding. He has installation instructions and how to use the WebUi. Although the installer I linked is still easier and faster than his methods of installing
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"> In the case of AI, there could be a fundamental barrier to progress.

Yes, I have considered this - there could be some sort of ""processing speed"" limit that we haven't found yet (similar to the speed of light) that could inhibit us from going ""full singularity"".

I.E. You need so much processing power to generate ""conciousness"", that you have to cut back on some of the power you give to information-seeking.

However...I confused my point by saying that these tools would be  ""indistinguishable from a human counterpart"", because you wouldn't really need it to be indistinguishable per-say to replace the job of a human.

Last night, I used ChatGPT to create working JS code for a server that allows 2 players to play Battleship against one another.

That's the sort of task you'd expect a junior developer to complete in a few days, maybe a week or two.  It was done in 30 seconds.

This technology has only been exposed to labelling data for (maybe?) a year.  In 3-4 years, it will be very hard to make an economical case for junior roles as they exist today.  

Even if it takes longer than that, do you really think junior roles will be around in 20 years?  What about 50?

The technology is coming, it is real, and it is pragmatic to prepare for it's arrival.

> Alternatively, it may be uneconomical to continue improving it.

Yeah, there is the economic reality to consider as well (see: Moore's Law).

However, again, this technology is still relatively nascent, and the financial incentives to build out a ""general developer"" are enormous.  The company that wins here will be able to leverage a monopoly on all software development, everywhere at once.  That's a trillion dollar opportunity, so I doubt capitalists will shy away from it too easily.

> Government regulation is another possibility.

Government regulation can't stop the progress here because we're in an arms race with every other country.  Unless the world governments ban it, you've got no chance of stopping this innovation.

... and even if the governments were to band together, you simply can't track rogue software developers as easily as you can track rogue nuclear arms manufacturers.

...and even then, the US military will almost certainly be ahead of the rest of the world on this.  You cannot stop the innovation with regulation unfortunately - it's just impractical.  (Unless of course we go full [Butlerian Jihad](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad)...but that's unlikely lol)"
Freelance,Anxiety around AI,"> You took it too far when talking about language model to the extreme = human intelligence.

Although that's not what I said, I agree with your point.  There's no reason to go that far when we're simply talking about AI replacing a human workforce.  As I said in another comment, you don't need a consciousness to produce better code/designs/product roadmaps than any human possibly could.

I understand that ChatGPT 4.X specifically will not be take anyone's jobs, what I am saying that as these sorts of models get more complex, they will start doing so.

Nobody really knows how soon that will be, and it might be much sooner than we think (especially when they start editing their own source).

*** 

> We have been able to approximate good enough creativity that it looks like real creativity.

(**Warning:** deviating from my original point again here because I find this idea interesting).

Nobody really knows if that's all there is to it.  

Is there some special ""something else"" required to go from a very powerful prediction engine (simulating creativity), to being able to make significant leaps in judgement (what one might consider ""genuine creativity"").  

Or, is that simply an emergent property of learning multiplied over a very long period of time.  We're already seeing strange emergent behavior that nobody was expecting in the relatively nascent ChatGPT models.

Hard to say ‚Äî interesting years ahead of though us that's for sure."
