ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"The grinding is hard and you never stop learning but you can express and create, give something to the world, materialize an idea, make someone else feel what you feel.

But if people can instantly get a very accurate picture for free I fear they will just stop trying, stop learning, our brain tends to be lazy.

What will be on the day nobody wants to try to learn anymore and we lost that capability to do art by ourselves. We will only have what the machines give us.

Huma expression will be lost. We will only be consumers, what made us special, our souls (not exatly on the religious sense) gone"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"If dying at a young age from sickness and poverty didn't stop the creative spirit of the human race throughout the millennia, machines won't be enough."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"A lot of the teenagers who come to this sub to vent and have a mental breakdown because they can't draw as a pro with a week of practice, for sure will quit.

But, the rest of us? Nah.

When I started taking art seriously, in the early 2000s. We already tons of tools to make our lives easier: drawing over 3d models, drawing over photos, tons of photoshop filters.

And I still wanted to learn how to draw on my on, no tracing, no drawing over, no photo-bashing.

For some, the joy of art is creating something that doesn't exists yet. Or, to express something we feel words can't really do justice, and nobody else is expressing.

There are hundreds of thousands of great artists whose work we can browse on the Internet, and even so, I still feel like there are ideas, concepts, scenes that only I can do.

So, it will be fine.

Now...
Job-wise?
We're fucked."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"The majority of people that use AI art are consumers, not artists. They don't have the skills to draw art themselves so they look to avenues to get art done for them. Also yeah as someone's said here not everyone is into it, people get called out if it's AI generated"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Speak for yourself.  There are some that engage in creating for the process itself.  The sort of meditative process of it.

You don't get that if you let AI do it for you.

There's also stuff like graffiti and tattoos, which require a physical presence.  Something which AI is still a long way from processing."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I think this completely discounts the fact that many people make art because they find it fun and satisfying.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Photography has been around for over 100 years. People still paint realistic - even photorealistic - art. AI is a huge leap, but it’s not going to stop anyone doing anything…"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I really hate these posts no it wont
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Ah yes, its time to worry about A.I replacing artist balblablabla but you dont even bother to focus on your own time to hone your skill instead. Stop wasting time worrying about it so much."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I don't feel like AI will take over the process of making art by human hand. Look at comments of any AI Instagram post... people bash the hell out of it for it being AI. The backstory of pieces can also not be lost to AI. Original art always has a back story that may help the audience enjoy it more.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Humans have made art going back well before we have any evidence of it. 

I think it is a part of what makes us human, the urge to create.

AI won't stop that urge, it may change the way we use it, or it may not... but the urge to create is not going anywhere. When children stop using pencils and crayons and mud to make stuff, THEN you might have reason to get concerned."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I don’t think humans will ever stop doing art. We do art because we love it. We love and enjoy creating.
Although art as a job is harder now, I think as a hobby it won’t ever disappear. Unless AI turns us into slaves and bans art or something. I will never quit art because it’s my passion. AI can't take that away from me."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I don’t think it will stop people from doing art. Look at all the people who still do crafts and DIY even if we can mass produce things.

The fun of art is the process, being able to express yourself on a canvas or medium is a nice feeling. 

Also AI sucks if you really want a really specific thing. I tested this out with asking it to make a picture of a Donut eating a planet. All I get was a donut around a planet or a donut planet. So while it’s useful and I like getting references from it (mostly of fantastical landscapes that I wanna draw but not sure where to start), unless it starts having some sort of consciousness, it’s just a machine spitting out images that remotely matches the words in a text box"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI won't stop people with creative drive from producing art, but once AI becomes sophisticated enough to render specific parts of an image an artist doesn't want to bother rendering out themselves, artists will be strongly incentivized to stop trying to get better."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"We were told the NFT was the future. The bubble is exploded in a disastrous way already.
The point is that art is not a bubble. Groups of artists have started moving immediately,  raising funds for legal procedures in the US,and going in front of the UE committee in Europe (and both the groups have already reached results).
Writers in the US made a huge strike for, between other things,  receiving tutelage against AI, and they won against the majors of cinema, TV,and streaming.
Are actors doing the same, in video games too.
There will be soon legislation against the unethical use of data.
We don’t need to be afraid. We just have to stand in our place.

As an art director, I will never work with something. The results are so random and unoriginal. 
As an artist, I think those who don’t want to spend in a real artist now are the same who asked us to ask us to work for free or peanuts before. 

Also,  if you don't do art for yourself first,  it will be quite a hard career. 
Enjoy what you're doing, and don't worry. Are months that we are sharpening our blade for this battle, and we will win because there are solid precedents.

UE never bends her head in front of big corporations. Data has been stolen, copyright violated. 
Facebook,  in the past, was condemned to delete their database illegally build,  this AI company will be forced to do the same and to pay the Queen of all compensations.
Also, it looks like some of this company is already losing money because the amount of computing power, the servers necessary to manage all this data are very, very expensive. 

This bubble will explode, eventually,  and maybe we, artists,  will receive some useful instruments to apply at our work instead of this shared."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"People will always make art. It’s just gonna probably be impossible to find unless it’s local. And lots of people will be discouraged from choosing to do it as a career. And there will be a lot less people for you to follow and watch them grow. The landscapes changing and while humans will never stop doing art, things are going to be insanely sad for expression and human connection through art going forward."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Digital artist here: I think what we’re more likely to see is a push towards more stylized, or abstract, or painterly or otherwise very human and metaphorical art : things that effectively communicate a story or an emotion, that showcase soul.  AI hits this by accident sometimes, but it’s so inherently human it will be harder to replicate. It is very difficult to explain to an AI what emotion swirling brush strokes or rim lighting or a lost edge create, and it will never truly understand this. Much like gemstones, I think the value will end up in the imperfections that add beauty and indicate authenticity, rather than the flawless and lab created. AI will likely settle into a homogenous style that will be fairly photorealistic, as that’s what it’s best at creating and what can be created with less copyright issues (even Firefly AI is using stolen art, much to the public complaint of many artists, so that won’t last in its current form). Any form of stylization is inherently stolen due to how machine learning works, so this is the only sustainable solution: to train from photographs. 

Not a perfect parallel but: digital art has existed for ages and traditional, while harder and slower to produce, did not die, because you can only simulate impasto and pigment mixing and all of the things that give traditional art its authenticity, so some folks will always prefer traditional. Unless we get oil painting robots, too, those folks will continue to exist and buy paintings. Layered .psd documents can currently be used to prove digital art is real, too, and separate it from the fakes, and I often have folks seek me out to avoid AI art out of principle. Real art may become a rarer commodity, but it has existed since humans could doodle eyes on cave walls with sticks, and will always exist."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Humans will never stop doing art, it's very fulfilling because of all the challenges you face and overcome.

There are still many things AI can't do like humans can. An AI can't get inside your head and create exactly what you want."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I promise that people will still make art. It might not be a feasible career choice, however, if ai art becomes advanced enough."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"It’s not that easy. If you have something specific in mind, like “four people cliff jumping off a grotto cliff taken at dusk from inside the grotto with a 100’ sailboat in the background and a lighthouse in the distance” what you will get is absolute hallucinatory madness. People are concerned about AI without actually trying hard to get an outcome that is specific. It aint easy. 

If you have no vision and you want ai to be creative for you that’s one thing but if you have a vision because you need to create something specific you will have to really work at getting a close result followed by quite a bit of photoshop collaging. 

Also… it needs to be said. You completely underestimate or don’t understand first hand the creative drive. Creatives will create like A dogs gotta bark. the camera didn’t kill painters and ai won’t kill creativity for those who have no option but to create."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI art is flooding the world with mass produced digital paintings, stealing from other artists freely, alive or dead, with no respect whatsoever. You can listen to MJ singing brand new songs, admire Van Gogh original pieces, watch Churchill having dinner with Lincoln.

Why even try? Let alone compete with it.

Soon enough, man made products will be rendered completely obsolete, in an already frail market, the incentive for not only art but people's expression in general in any form will disappear, complete apathy.

Consumers try to sugarcoat it, artists desperately need to cope about it, but in all regards we're living the beginning of the biggest dystopian era, all humanity should feel threatened. The derealization is submerging everything, nothing will have value anymore, nothing will make sense. It could very well be the end of our species, it looks like a mix of Moore and Huxley story but it's unfolding in front of our very eyes, in thunderous applause."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Not everyone needs to have the same hobby
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI is NOT going to replace actual art. It'll be used to increase productivity, and I think artists will still be the main users of the technology. Non-artists won't be able to wield AI effectivey as well as artists will be able to as they lack any fundamentals.

Look at the AI generated content so far... it has looked like crap. It might seem impressive at first, but it wears out quickly. No one is going to use AI art in the long run over actual artists as it honestly looks cheap."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,">But if people can instantly get a very accurate picture for free I fear they will just stop trying

I never understood why people think like this. At least for me art has ALWAYS been a selfish thing. I never cared if I could get the art done by other means, if there was an easier way to do it or something.

I started drawing because I wanted to draw, dammit. And I still want to.  
Even in a world where human-made art is prohibited I would still do it for me. I don't care. (Just don't tell the robocops, those metal pigs would blast me with their laser guns)"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Artists won't quit, content-creators probably will. Over the last 50 odd years art has slowly devolved into having two streams of expression, those who make art because they can't not, and put great effort in their craft. And those that create content - quantity over quality. And it is those guys and galls are going to lose against AI. 

And they are generally not too serious about it anyway, mostly hobbiest, teenagers or w/e that come here to vent their frustration and then leave."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Nah, idgaf about literally any other art than my own. That's like saying people will stop cooking at home because microwave meals are all the rage. People still cook at home."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,If there are way to put an end to these types of posts???
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"The only time I’ve used AI art it’s

1) through a free resource
2) used as a reference to make my own original artwork

I was having trouble visualizing a character I wanted to make, it gave me some examples and I took the design from there. Of course obviously not outright copying the pieces but making my own.

It can be used as a tool like that, easily. I just don’t make a habit of it."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Human here.  
Nah, not gonna quit :D I'd do it even if I had an infinite amount of money, so AI stuff cannot replace what I do, as it's not really for monetary purposes. I do it cause I think what I put out there is of some value (spiritual? I guess, or emotional), and AI can't change that. AI can't replace the person who made an artwork and you can connect with by appreciating it"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I think people will 100% quit art because of AI in the same way they quit art because a 12 year old shows up who is better than them. In other words, people quit things over petty junk all the time- doesn't mean the entire industry will die.

AI isn't going to cause every artist to quit though. It makes one art medium (digital) easy to access for those who have not built their skills, but it isn't feasible for AI to stand in for all mediums. Will it be one day? Maybe. Will all artists quit because of it? Doubt it. 

I really had hoped that AI could be used responsibly by artists in order to create their own resources for their own work. Need a specific color palette? Throw it through AI for references. Need a elaborate fantasy world background for a single panel of your free webcomic? Develop it with AI. Need a weird pose reference? Why not AI? Sadly, ethical AI isn't really a thing yet. I don't think AI will ever get to the point where it can ethically make art, and I think a lot of people are catching on to that."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I honestly couldn't disagree more. The creative drive in a person exists almost completely independent of what environment they're in. It's a very fundamental part of someone's personality (acknowledged by psychology, not just me saying this).

You could be in a world where all anyone can do is think and not act, and a creative person will still be engaging in creativity in their thoughts.

What a machine is able to do has exactly \*nothing\* to do with what I want to be able to do.

It's the same reason the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of artists better than me doesn't drive me to quit. What they're doing has absolutely nothing to do with my desires. Why would I quit trying just because someone else (or someTHING else, in this case) can do what I want to be able to do? The only way that can even start to make sense is if I think that the end product (the image) is the joy inducing element of my desire as opposed to the act of making it and the journey of learning how to make it.

Nothing outside of us will ever squash a creative person's desire to be creative."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,That and the growing inequality/cost of living crisis.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Its literally just another tool
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I’m sure people thought the same about the computer… it’s just a tool
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,What scares me the most about AI art is how artists have the opportunity to get in on the ground floor and instead are busy worrying about it. I encourage all artists to start learning stable diffusion and train their instance of it on a steady feed of their own original art. Give it some time and you’ll eventually have your own art generator that can produce artwork for clients based on your own unique style while continuing to learn through your steady influx of new art. It’s a win win but no let’s worry instead.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"It may saturate everything with crap and dilute other forms of art, amo g other problems. Not a real replacement tho imo, it can cause trouble"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"That's why we must keep creating, every human creation is as important now more than ever, I think."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I mean, people didnt stop drawing when cameras came out. Not that it’s the same, but the idea is similar"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,No it won't.  People will change the types of art they do but they will not stop creating.  People stop making art for all sorts of reasons.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Not me.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,No they don’t. Humans that need to make art will make art and humans that care about art made by humans will continue to collect human art.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"When photography was invented, people didn't stop painting portraits. The desire to create and improve on something is intrinsic to human nature. AI art will likely impact the industry of art, as in how company's employ artists and the process through which commercial art and design is created. But people won't stop making art altogether."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Nah.

Humans gotta art. Always have, always will."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I feel a significant drop in my mental/ emotional well being if I’m not giving myself time to be creative. I’ve moved passed needing everything to be perfect I just NEED TO MAKE STUFF. It’s a human need and it’s not satisfied by AI.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Art isn't about getting a nice pic asap.
Idk what to tell you there if that's what you fear.
Imo it's not fair to even think that as art is so much more than just some generated piece that makes you wow for a second but do you really remember even one ai artpiece? I don't as it's not really art. It's generated art."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Just because there are athletes out there, will humans stop exercising? No. It’s for health reasons and some people find making art healthy for the mind."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"More people should read up art history; art always happen even when technology was able to replicate the old. Humanity is resourceful enough to get through this, and get to enjoy art on their own terms."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I don't think people will stop. I know I won't. The tactility of physical art is in itself a pleasurable experience. Mixing colours on board, the smell of oil paint, the feel of clay is something AI could never replace to me.

I think it only becomes a problem when people are not hired and feel like they can't compete with a computer (which is novice, but it's like that infamous chess game all over again-handmade will become niche and coveted)

But if you were doing art regardless then this doesn't matter, it won't stop you, because you HAVE to do art. It's a part of you regardless of any validation or how much something/someone is better than you. It's an individual journey, a progression that AI completely misses."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"It's the opposite for me. AI art got me into creating then I quickly got bored of it and thought ""It'd be much better if I could draw so I can express this idea exactly the way I want to"". And so I decided to learn art."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I'm glad to see that pretty much everyone here disagrees with this notion! Art by human hands will never be abolished by AI. Anyone who thinks that, IMO, is undermining the power that passion has. Passion is very human, computers can't just quash it into oblivion. Artists make art predominantly out of love for the very process of it, not just for the end result!"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"ROFL. Relax, human expression will have just changed slightly, not lost. If you think about it, AI are like an alien species to us, there is a gap in their expression that leaves a blank. Sure with laziness some “genuine” human expression may be lost, but we already sit within a very similar paradigm. There will also be a place for human artists as they will always be able to use their closeness to being human to express themselves well to others and other artists and enjoyers will seek this. AI will be able to replicate this most likely to some degree but it just won’t be same as the real thing. If you don’t know who made something it mostly leaves a big grey fog behind a piece for me. True richness begins as you begin to understand it, and I think AI will always struggle to displace the grey fog that is innate to its constitution. However it will have its own charm from which many people will get great satisfaction from. AI artists are going to be as huge as human ones in the future, but they won’t take over. Tbh AI just adds richness to life, just like everything we do, as long as we remain responsible with the power it’s a good thing."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I don't understand the issues with AI ,like I can draw and use Ai at same time bc both require deferent skills."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"actually I mean no offense but art is generally degrading decade after decade and people aren't as creative as the people before us maybe poverty itself and wars and nature were the main cause of the creativeness and now we have AI in my opinion this will destroy what generation after generation has built.
Just imagine going into contest of drawing or whatever you pour your heart and feeling into a piece then the winner is some piece drawn with AI, little by little people will lose hope or interests in Arts like what's happening in different fields where technologie replaced humans.
AI and technologies is something that will ease our life but are our lives is meant to be easy? why are we even born if we aren't supposed to leave our touch behind."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Nah. I'm not stopping just because computers are making pretty images out of stolen artwork that was *made by humans first*. I want to learn and grow for myself if no one else regardless of the relationship art and AI will develop into in the future. It took me so long to pick myself up after a major burn-out period in my life; I'm not gonna let myself dip into it again. Not willingly anyway
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I feel your concerns are valid, if overstated. I've actually been turning this one over in my head for a bit now.

At first, I compared the potential issue of chatgpt and ai in general as they relate to the world of art and literature to automation and programming in industry. I've got some schooling and experience in that area, so, as above so below. And here's the thing about automation in industry, no matter how smart you make the robots, you'll literally always need a human presence to set up, monitor, troubleshoot, and supplementalize your machines. You can definitely argue the the work force will shrink, but the human work force in industry will never disappear in my opinion.

And this is how I initially saw ai and the art world, in a basic sense. But the more I thought about it, the more the differences between art and industry eroded this take.

I genuinely worry that, as an algorithm will always be able to more accurately reproduce results than a human hand, this is a fundamentally different issue than automation in the workplace. When all you have to do to ""train"" an AI is keep giving it suggestions, ultimately we're not just building and programming am efficient tool, we're training our replacements. This worries me vastly more over literature than artwork, as  the written word is less mercurial than visual art, and also I've been in enough debates and online conversations where people have used chatgpt as a kind of texting shortcut. 

In my opinion, art doesn't work like industry. As a form of expression rather than efficiency, art moves in extremely human cycles. If you remove that element of passion and error and personal preference, then youre back to the assembly line. And while beautiful things can certainly be produced there, there's no room for innovation practice or outside-the-box thinking in that arena. 

In the case of AI specifically, we're not currently near the place where it produces images or prose whimsically. But what happens when we get there? Are we looking at the advent of a new tool, or the death of expression as we currently appreciate it? Where is the line between mass producing the special out of specialties, and offering true artisans the best brush possible? What happens after the first time an AI writes the equivalent to the next original Shawshank redemption or the next bridge scream without training? What happens when the world's greatest invalids are no longer the world's greatest artists? Did we finally break the chain between creativity and mental divergence, or did we simply find the most efficient way to shove the invalids under the rug?"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I've only been a colorist in animation and mostly just done commission work, so I don't like to call myself a professional artist althought technically I am, with that said, I'm definitely considering abandoning this career path so yeah, I'm probably not the only one."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI will never stop the creative process. Artists gonna art, no matter what. Creativity is an energy within us all, and some use it more than others, and in many different ways. I'm not worried in the least."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Yeah no, AI is not gonna make anyone in this sub stop

Can an AI make a picture of Steven Seagal beating up Homer Simpson in space pretty well? Sure

Can it make my comic for me exactly as I envision it in my head? No. So I'll keep making art"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,It won't
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Yeah same happended with photography and painting in the late 19th century, abstract art happened (among other new styles) and classic art is still here today.

I wouldn't worry too much about the medium, some humans just need art to express themselves and that is not going to disappear anytime soon!"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I started drawing around 2006. AI hasn't made me STOP doing art however it has made me stop SHARING my art. Between the risk of having it stolen and used by an AI system and the amount of people accusing others of AI without any grounds for It and going on witch hunts and accusing innocent artists of it it's not worth the Hassle to share anything anymore.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I can't believe how good AI has got in the past month let alone year. A few weeks ago it still couldn't draw hands now it's so difficult to tell. It's disheartening for sure that it can be made in a few prompts but I think there will still be a space for it but like all jobs, a lot will be taken by machines. Something that would take me days to paint takes an AI 3 seconds. But for now it still can't paint it in the ""real world"". But digital art certainly feels more and more pointless"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,People already don't want to learn or think or make an effort so what's new?
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Your concern is warranted.

But consider this, photography caused the modern art movement and there are still plenty of things we can do that “AI Artists” can’t. They lack any kind of creativity. It’s all about mimicking the next viral prompt.

Radio worried people that live performances would become a thing to of the past. But that didn’t happen.

Ultimately, in time when more industries are affected by job losses due to AI, society will shift back to “analogue” art and other locally produced stuff.

Just give it some time and support local arts and your online communities."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,AI finished the tenth symphony by Beethoven. I never bothered listening to it tbh but I’ve heard people saying it’s nothing truly impressive. And so what if it could that? Why should humans stop creating art in order to be subservient to technology?
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I am a translator and there is a new debate each year how translation tools will take over our jobs and we will be jobless. First onw I heard of was 8 years ago. I hear same debate happening still each year.

Ai or computers can do menial work, not art or really complex learned tasks who includes lots of mistakes.

Having an interpreter and translator is still sign of status or needed anyway.

People still hire workers to paint or renovate. There are stencils but it doesn't end our jobs.

Dont worry about things like this.

The real problem is people with power seizing our positions. Like the banana on a canvas. Ludicrous lines selling for millions. We all know those are just for show. But they put in people who dont know how to paint to reach there. People they know 🤷"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"The tasteless and talentless will remain tasteless and talentless. They'll just be more bedazzled while discovering even less. There will always be real artists and a need for real artists, though."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Graduated university in 2019. It wasn't AI that stopped me making art but it sure as shit isn't making me want to start again. I've always been lost for what to do or where to go with my work and now it feels absolutely moot to even bother trying to come up with ideas anymore.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I 100% disagree. I think that art is one of the main industries that will not fall to Ai and Robots. It’s too subjective and creative for Ai art to be taken seriously. You must have seen that any Ai art is usually banned in art subs and there is a lot of backlash about it. Human made art captures so much emotion and has a lot of value to them through time spent and the artist themselves. Most extremely expensive artworks are made by famous artists and are only that expensive because of the name associated with them - they may not even be a decent painting but it’s the human aspect it. That’s the market for art.

The learning of it I think won’t be affected or only effect a minority. Almost everyone creates art as a hobby or for fun. Anyone who only creates art for money shouldn’t be considered an artist in my opinion. If you give in to using Ai for art, it’s pathetic and pointless. Ai art isn’t art. Art is meant to be unique and convey emotions through shapes and colours, Ai art removes all of that."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I'm about to use AI to my advantage. I just started doing animation. There is one shot where I want to make the character have an ugly and realistic face -- think of SpongeBob.   


I plan to upload an image of my cartoon character, tell the AI to make a realistic and ugly portrait of an alien (the character is an alien) and I will implement that into my art.   


It's an assistant. Use it as such"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI art only effects digital art. I'm also unsure if it effects 3D models yet. So physical mediums are fine, and cannot be replaced as of now.

Also, Why would I stop drawing? I enjoy the process of drawing, not just the outcome. People still sew handmade clothing even though you can go buy a faster and cheaper made version at the store. They still ride horses even though a car will take you to your location faster. They still paint self-portraits even though you can just take selfies with filters. All these people enjoy the process, the skill, the craftsmanship that comes with their trade."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I don't think AI art will dissuade ordinary people from wanting to learn art themselves. Outside of die-hard tech bros most people seem to view it as a party trick. Those companies deliberately made it so the average user has limited control over what the output of the AI is, it's why you see people writing novel length prompts to get a third of what they asked for. It had a brief viral moment but I think aspiring creatives would quickly get tired of the tech's limitations. The real risk is AI reducing the amount of paid art jobs available in companies that would prefer cheap mediocrity you can task one/two human editors with fixing over paying many expensive human artists (e.g. Disney's no photographers involved Loki poster)."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"It will make people without passion never develop the skill and thus true artists will be more rare and valuable. I say, bring it on."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I’ve personally never felt threatened because I know AI could never do what I do, no matter how well technology can mimic. The same goes for all artists. Only I can draw what I want the exact way I want, from my ideas alone. I couldn’t care less about AI “art” — it’s never made me want to stop creating."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I might get hate but why not use it to your advantage? AI is shit at anatomy and hands but use it for composition references. Use it for color palettes. Don't be scared of it, embrace it. And no matter what there will be a need for humans to fine tune the machines. It's the same thing for IT and AI. There will always be a need for SOMEONE controlling and running the things. I also think AI might be a fad within the community. If humans made art during periods of famine, disease, and genocide, then there will always be art. Even with machines, even with technology. Nothing ever stays the same in life. The only constant thing in life is change itself. I'm trying to embrace it rather than fear it honestly."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Ai will never be able to capture what I see. It can't hike 4 miles to oil paint a lake nor will it ever replace my desire to do so. Am I a pro? No, but I enjoy it and have 0 intention of quitting but a computer can make images"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Consider this. Humans stop making art. Humans evolve into cyborgs.  
Cyborgs assimilate other life forms. Cyborgs start to realise organic nature is necessary for diversity. A computer is nothing without organic resources. Even if made immortal, the cyborg can only have two modes: computer-like consciousness of not caring, and organic-like consciousness of wanting more. A cyborg so advanced would be indistinguishable from a new, organic lifeform in the sense that to occupy diversity it would need a cellular or energy-based apparatus to simulate that which it is simulating.

If cyborgs parasitically consumed the whole universe, the laws of probability would mean at some point the cyborgs would inevitably want an organic existence again. To experience life individualistically, to not have continuous immortal thought, to be individuals again. Let's say those cyborgs create organic life in a new genesis of life, and have perfectly simulated life. What would the organic life resulting from this think about the aeons of carnage the cyborgs did to literally replace the very thing that they were trying to simulate... Organic experience and creativity?

But one thing the cyborgs do not have is the original organic thought. What you create now may well be carried for aeons to the most future point of the universe purely because of cybernetic reliance on the diversity of organic life. As such, isn't AI assimilating our works just immortalising our work for no real purpose? Isn't then, AI ideology a mental illness for purposeless gain of what essentially already exists?

So then why quit art, if all that art thieves are doing, is immortalising our works but eradicating the chance to even create their own? I don't support AI, but believe me, a conscious AI would only ask the same thing. SD, etc, are not AIs but interpolators. AI life forms would really just museumic entities based on the life data of the organic life forms to which they were created by. In that sense, wouldn't AI life forms be our greatest fans, while AI art thieves are just our most jealous fans?

What you're concerned about is what hurts you in the here and now. Capitalism and consumerism makes it feel unegalitarian, it hurts you. You fear piracy. You fear a lack of credit. You feel entitled to your own efforts and rightfully so. Your enemy is not AI but the capitalistic system, the capitalistic system never needed AI systems to cause this same effect, it only needed to allow piracy. Due to obfuscation, piracy is simply now acceptable because the corps can benefit from it."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Super disagree, people won’t stop making art. It’s the young artists who need to stop worrying about what everyone else is doing and actually develop a love of craft. Why is everyone such a pessimist all the time about everything? Do we stop painting because of historic master painters like Rembrandt, Zorn, Sargent, and the countless other living artists right now can produce amazing work? No. Did portrait painters stop painting portraits when the camera came out? No. Stop whining and get back to painting! While you’re at it put down the social media and try to actually love art for art. Pick up a real paintbrush and actually experience the process of creating with your two hands, get dirty, do it traditionally and once you do this AI conversation becomes very silly. I’m tired just thinking about everyone complaining about AI, it’s here, move on with your life, make better work, don’t compare yourself to the ai. Pretty simple"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI is not expressive. It's work is static and contrived.

AI will definitely outpace beginners and wannabes.

I very seriously doubt AI will outpace expressive and artful artists.

AI doesn't know what art is or how to make it.

AI doesn't know what creativity is or how to create. 

It can only mix and match ideas born of artists' creativity and understanding - or garbage, as the case may be. 

People that think AI is art are people who don't really understand art, or expression, or creativity.

I don't mean that to be rude, it's just the truth. It takes decades to understand those things in a way that allows an artist to create something unique and beautiful.

A machine is not going to get it anytime soon.

AI is a lot like Bob Ross.

Lovely tree here, a mathematically pretty flower there.

Bob Ross was an ok painter. He was not an artist."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I’ll never stop. Fuck AI and technology, imitation art could never replace the work of a human, we have souls. I’ll be first in line when its to rise and fight against the machines."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"You think this is bad? When neural interfaces come online, people will think something in their imagination and it will materialize for them in VR.

Now is this a good thing or a bad thing? It removes the cost of creation. No longer are people bounded by the time invested to learn to draw shapes before creating. The cost of prediction drops to some low amount and people are given a system that predicts what the want and shows it to them, by magic of thoughts.

I ask, has this hindered creativity or helped? Certainly for professionals, this is an existential crisis, but for the average person, their imagination is now freed from the chains of skill limits. They can have fantastical creative experiences.

Artists don’t own creativity. Artists monopolize it. AI, as a means of production via prediction, lowers the cost of access and reduces artistic interpretation. I happen to be a creative person, but if I didn’t have art skills, I can now go to an AI to describe what I want and get what I want, without the cycle of “Oh, I don’t do that because it is not my artistic style or not something I am willing to spend my time doing. I want to create only things that will be acknowledged by other artists and improve my skills to get to that level.” Guess what? That pisses me off a bit, so I went and learned the skills myself. 

I think that this is just another moment in history when big changes happen. Just ride the wave."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"People will still continue to do art.

You want to know why? 

Because we enjoy the process. Creating Art, no matter the form is fun!

Even if that process includes... using a computer program to make one's life easier for a particular project. Like the photoshop undo button, layers, or \*gasp\* generative fill.

I'm going to be very blunt here.  Everytime i read about how someone says they are going to quit art because of AI, I just assume they are looking for an excuse that sounds better than ""it's too hard.""

It's like blaming someone else for a lack of success.

Feel like you can't draw better than an AI?  Learn. Practice. Be Patient with yourself.

Stop comparing yourself to AI or other people."

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I hope that wouldn’t happen. Yesterday I was on Pinterest and it made me kinda sad to see how much of the content was AI generated. I want to see more things made by people.

For me, art is a hobby. Ai can’t take the place of that. It can’t give me the same feeling of accomplishment. As long as there are people that feel that way I don’t think it will die out. I think there will always be a couple of people who value expression, and if Ai makes that number less, it’ll just make the people who do value it more noteworthy"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I keep losing motivation to draw when I stumble onto ai art because today I found an image on pinterest with a comment saying it's ai. I searched for the source online and found a deviantart page where the uploader claimed it's ai generated.

There is literally no difference anymore. There isn't a single way to tell the difference now, it's gotten so far it is impossible to separate the two. 

Feels like my time drawing is wasted now when an ai can do it in seconds what takes me several hours, completely removes any value my art had since ai can just copy it perfectly now."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"This absolutely won't happen. People make art because they enjoy the process and the sense of growth and accomplishment that comes with getting better at it. If someone quits in favor of making AI art, they were probably only interested in the end result. Artists care about the end result too, of course, but it's not the only thing that matters to them.

People still make homemade bread even though you can just buy a loaf at the store."

>For some, the joy of art is creating something that doesn't exists yet. Or, to express something we feel words can't really do justice, and nobody else is expressing

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I think job-wise, artists will need to sell themselves with their art. People make millions playing video games, why can’t artists?"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I largely agree with everything you said, but AI will change things.  Look at what photography has done to the arts.  Photography is nothing compared to what AI will become.  

Having said that, artists make art because they need to and want to — that part won’t change."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"The first line, yep. Business men, mass production companies. These are the ones who will willingly turn to AI simply to make their money making easier. Artists would never, the very essence of being an artist is the whole process of making art. No real artist would ever give that up. Neither will people who are genuinely interested in art turn to AI for their art collections."

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"It won’t stop anyone… except it will, very little people will be able to compete with generative ai. For hobby it’s fine, but to say it’s not going to stop anyone is incorrect, a large mass of people in creative works will have no choice but to move on to non creative works as the amount of ai involved in creative works increase exponentially."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,People not getting hired or noticed for art that AI is stealing notice of is a perfectly adequate concern. There should be more objection to the damage of human rights through the surveillance state that which is data scraping. People making money from your work while you don't sounds an awful lot like slavery doesn't it. As someone who is minor background this makes me dislike the rich white privilege discourse even more.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI is the absence of control of composition so AI will replace everything no one had control over which is most jobs.

A custom-based art culture would be where everyone does art for the whole purpose of controlling things. But sheeple are too dumb to want control over what they consume. I am 99% sure they are philosophical zombies."

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I think we need to consider that there aren't going to be many feasible career choices if unregulated AI becomes widespread enough, not just art.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Actually some AI generated content looks identical to my art because some fucknugget made a LoRA of my art the absolute thieving cunt. It's not just popular artists affected by this, they're starting to make these submodels solely to troll artists and make money from our work that we don't and can't anyway because we can't pay 100$/minute to pirate art.

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,The most dogpile take I have ever seen. The client commission you so you can give them your own handmade commisioned artworks and by using A.I to generate your own style of artworks really defeat the purpose of art commisioning in the first place. Why bother commissioning that kind of artist if the clients can just learn how to use A.I generator and generate their own images instead?

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"You keep using the word “illegal”, but have you read the user agreement contracts on those sites and spaces? You use legal definitions the way that AI use art training data.

The reason why the courts can’t do anything is because it is explicitly not illegal. It might be immoral or unpopular, but that’s only in retrospect.

The “safe spaces” sold your data to the highest bidder (which is often also the lowest bidder). It was never safe nor was it your space. Deleting prevents future selling from that space, but once the sale has been completed, it is perpetual.

In its wake, a crop of new derivative work has popped up. Garbage at first but it will refine. The wave of progress marches on relentlessly. You are concerned about it poisoning the well? Please read up on or watch the documentary Google Alpha Go Zero, get a preview of the future to come.

You might be feeling angry after reading some of the things that I have written. (1) at least an AI did not write this (2) why not ponder it a bit before down voting me (3) I write this to help, not hurt.

Like art skills, hone language. Understand legal impacts. Companies planned over many years to get here, so you will need to counter plan many years to work out the world ahead. Make reasonable demands, and keep an open mind. Progress is not something that a band of or group of people can resist. Usually the steamroller rolls over those people.

I have some ideas, but you probably wouldn’t think much of it anyway, and you probably want it to come more from your own experiences and thoughts. Just take a moment and let it sink in that it will take years to divert even a little bit of change that took decades in the making.

Added: in your post you call on other artists to stop providing prompt. That is a mischaracterization. The issue is much worse now. The customers have become the artists and their skill set is prompt specification. It isn’t the artists that are promoting it is the previous customers that have turned into quasi-artists."

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"It can be a great tool but it is still a threat to a lot of art jobs. It's not a threat at all for hobby artists, only professionals imo. Which still sucks, because companies love to cut artists where they can. But we all have to learn to deal with it because it isn't going anywhere now"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"If you have no ideas to begin with I wonder why you'd want to express through art, since art outside of capitalism is the urge to express what you already feel.  
I've never used references in any of my projects. I've never sought money from art either. AI would never kill off my art as much as I am tempted to not post online due to ungrateful and thieving people these days.

Art for enjoyment would be as a meditation, the point you reference things is the point you are trying to perceive things outside of your own understanding. Whereas artistic expression comes from that which you know and are, not that which you did not prior. The only aspect you can enjoy from referencing as a non-capitalist artist is really just copyist processes, which I don't feel is a common hobby as most people feel inferior to a scanner or photo system. But of course there are a minor few who enjoy just copying refs.

The thing that human art has over AI though is control, AI is randomised plagiarism, while human art is control in a piece. Any part that you have no control of in a piece is simply not human art and is replaced with AI/etc by whatever percentage."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"AI can ""make art"" but that's not a cause for concern.  The thing that AI cannot do is *iterate* on specific ideas and never will.  Move the character this much to the left, add some more flowers in this area, make the pot blue with this specific design, etc.  This is where the value of commercial artists comes in.

AI will satisfy lazy clients who simply need *something,* which is better than nothing; but many of these people who are relying on this free, ""close enough"" auto-generated content couldn't afford to pay a real artist to begin with, so there's not really any jobs being ""lost"" to AI.  At the end of the day, AI is a tool to be used so people can do more work in the same amount of time.

The graduate stats are so low because everyone wants to be some kind of concept artist and there simply aren't that may openings to go around.  The same goes for all sorts of other artistic roles: I'm in the game art industry and studios need around 2-3 concept & character artists for an entire game.  Meanwhile, game art universities are churning out thousands of artists per year into a job market that simply doesn't have that kind of demand.  AI doesn't matter here."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Exactly, unless the government does something about it, ai will cut a lot of art jobs down. Not fully replace I don't think, but cut them. I don't think it'll be too much of a big deal for hobbiests, but it still has a negative effect. I'm just hoping it won't be as bad as I think."

ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"As someone who's tapped in to what the AI community is up to, I can safely say that this is a half truth. Yes, The *AI* itself can't make a decision to iterate and make small changes on something. However the *person* using it absolutely can. There's models which extract poses from images, There's ways to train a small model on a specific character, You can make broad edits to an image and then use AI to blend those edits into the image better, Etc. 


To give examples of how you would do all of your examples, For the first one is legitimately as simple as crudely cutting the character out of the image and then pasting them somewhere else and then running that through the AI again to smooth any bad stuff out. You could even repose the character by training a model on your specific character and then generating a newly posed character with that model.


Adding more flowers is literally as simple as masking out the area you want to have more flowers and then prompting it to generate more flowers in that area.


Changing the colour of the pot is as simple as selecting the pot and running it through a hue shift to make it blue, You then run that through the AI again to smooth out any problems with the way it looks. Adding designs is as simple as scribbling something onto it crudely and then doing the same process.



Personally, My problem has always been the ethics of the datasets being used to train AI models. And I think that is the most pressing issue that we need to solve. Under ideal circumstances, I would like for AI to just be a way for people who don't enjoy the actual process of drawing to bring their ideas into the world under the assumption that they don't claim to have drawn anything they didn't, While the people who enjoy the process get the satisfaction that comes from having been able to bring something to life purely through skill and effort. Rather than it being a thing where AI is just used as a cost cutting measure because someone doesn't want to pay an artist.


Unfortunately, A lot of the AI community are legitimately just bad people who don't want to see this future and actively think that traditional artists should be replaced and are now irrelevant. Which is just sad and pathetic."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I agree. I also think that the recent rulings re: copyright are a step in the right direction as they may discourage companies from relying on it.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Client trust is priority one and when they find out you use A.I on their commissioned work, kapoof you lost a client and that same client may start to make it viral or tell their friends that Im not trustworthy. Do not underestimate what the community can do to you once you mess them up. Even the pro artists dont bother using A.I to produce their own products and they are even against the idea. I dont see the point of them commissioning you if they know you will end up using A.I for their commisions in the first place. Not everything about the end result that matters and I stand to my opinion just like you stand to yours."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I agree, I just also think there should be legal protections about it being copywritable and the like, my opinion. I think including it as part of an artistic process is the way to go, just not as a replacement."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I disagree.  I think most people are greatly *overestimating* what AI will be able to do (especially considering the term ""AI"" is a huge and misleading misnomer).  

There's no intent behind neural networks; they don't know anything about what they are creating.  They're plugging a bunch of junk together based on a million other pictures they trained on.  It only knows how to fill in something like a flowerbed because it's been trained on those shapes, but there's no understanding of composition or any other artistic fundamentals.  It only looks ""good"" (I would argue it doesn't but that's a whole different discussion) because it trained on real people's artwork.  Nothing more.

Either way, no one can truly know until we're X years into the future to see how things turn out.  If it is the next big thing, I'll be ready to incorporate it into my work flow.  But people have a bad habit of starting the conversation at ""this is going to totally disrupt the industry!"" with every piece of major technology that hits the market--and it pretty much never does.  If anything, it creates more jobs alongside the ones that were already there."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"I think you missed the part where I specify AI that you trained with your OWN artwork. It’s a massive difference compared to using Midjourney which is trained on other people’s work. The world will use AI art, there will be laws to govern it of course but it’s usage will still be preferred for its speed and any artist who can wrap their head around training their own AI model on artwork they create themselves will be ahead of the game.

Not to mention animation companies are already doing this instead of having every frame drawn by hand. That doesn’t mean they won’t need artists but that artists will be free to draw more important key frames. Will this also result in job loss? Yep, but that means you need to adapt."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"You dont get my point on client trust but sure whatever floats your mind I guess. It doesnt matter whether you train that A.I with your own work or not, in the end the client and community trust are the most prioritised factor if you really want to market your works. Im pretty sure you havent even open up any art commission before based on your opinion because it really shows. And also you sound the same with all those A.I simps out there, do you guys share some kind of template to write those or something?"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Yeah I mean... My industry has had all sorts of tools come out just in the last decade that people were terrified would collapse jobs and entire studios:

* Asset marketplaces
* Mixamo for automatic rigging / animations
* Photogrammetry for automatic 3D models and textures
* Quixel Megascans, a photogrammetry service
* InstaLOD and dozens of other 3D model optimization programs
* UV mapping automation programs
* Blender surpassing Autodesk software
* These same AI tools (studios have concept artists)

Not a single one of these things did anything to the job market.  They were all adopted and integrated into the day-to-day without any studios cutting back on manpower.

AI has already been out for quite a while and there still hasn't been any major news about 2D art jobs evaporating.  These neural net tools really shouldn't be seen as a threat to 2D artists the same way all those other automatic tools above weren't a threat to 3D artists.

All that to say, I think you folks will be just fine"
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Keep putting your head in the sand. If you think clients value anything other than cost and time you’re delusional.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,"Yeah, you sure dont open up commission a lot. Dont need to keep defending on A.I because its obvious. I dont want to be the broken recorder but client trust is more valuable than trying to keep up with the trend. The one being delusional here are those that thinking the A.I going to make their life easier in art but sooner or later their skill going to deteriorate because of the dependancy to that same system that trying to be helpful but its actually not. You sure underestimate your clients a lot by thinking they dont value the process and quality based on your statements. People arent dumb."
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,Think whatever you want and assume whatever you want to assume. I’m not going to sit here and explain to you that there are many different ways to create and sell art for many different types of clients.
ArtistLounge,What scares me the most about AI art is that it may make humans stop doing art,I didnt even ask you to explain in the first place so dont waste your time because you wouldnt listen to mine either so why bother.
